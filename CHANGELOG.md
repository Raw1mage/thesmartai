## [1.1.45] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed - Antigravity Model Communication (Critical) ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: Antigravity models were completely non-functional, showing "This version of Antigravity is no longer supported" errors and requests stuck in "Build" state.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Version Incompatibility** (`fingerprint.ts:22`): Code randomly selected from 6 versions (1.14.0-1.15.8), but Antigravity server only accepts 1.15.8 since 2026-01-24. This caused 83% failure rate.
2. **Missing Transform Logic** (`request.ts:824-832`): `applyGeminiTransforms` function existed but was never called, causing request format mismatches.
3. **Hardcoded Debug Logs** (`index.ts:1364-1370`): Console.log statements always printed debug info regardless of configuration.

**Critical Fixes**:
- **Version Fix**: Updated `ANTIGRAVITY_VERSIONS` array to only include `["1.15.8"]`
- **Account Data Fix**: Updated stored account data to use version 1.15.8
- **Transform Implementation**: Added `isGeminiModel()` check and proper `applyGeminiTransforms()` call with all required options
- **Claude Transform**: Unified Claude transformation logic using `applyClaudeTransforms()`
- **Debug Cleanup**: Removed hardcoded console.log statements

**Verification** (All Completed ✅):
- ✅ All 129 Gemini transform tests pass
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Version warnings eliminated
- ✅ Models respond normally to messages (tested with Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking)
- ✅ Cache cleared and server restarted
- ✅ Multiple successful conversations confirmed

**Reference**: GitHub Issue [#324](https://github.com/NoeFabris/opencode-antigravity-auth/issues/324)

**Key Insight**: This bug was difficult to diagnose because:
- Random version selection masked the problem (intermittent failures)
- Multiple failure points (version + transform) created compound issues
- Error messages were misleading (focused on version, not request format)
- Full server restart was required for all fixes to take effect

### Added
- **Rate Limit Dashboard**: Added `/dashboard` command to view real-time rate limit status and cooldown timers for all Antigravity accounts.


## [1.1.44] - 2026-01-30



### Fixed
- **Antigravity Chat**: Fixed `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_URL]` by handling relative URLs (e.g., `v1beta/models/...`) in the Antigravity fetch wrapper.
- **Model List**: Resolved model count discrepancy by strictly filtering Antigravity models (blocking legacy/experimental artifacts) and prioritizing account emails in TUI display.
- **Accounts**:
    - Fixed "Time Travel" / crash issue caused by a corrupted `accounts.json` (trailing comma).
    - Hard-removed ghost account `gemini-cli-subscription-gemini-cli`.
    - Re-enabled Anthropic models by removing them from the ignored list and adding fallback population.
- **TUI Navigation**:
    - Mapped `Left Arrow` key to "Back" (exit/clear) in `/models`, `/accounts`, and `/connect` menus.
    - Mapped `a` key in `/models` to open `/accounts` (Accounts TUI) instead of `/connect`.

## [1.1.43] - 2026-01-30

- Implemented strict account isolation for Google login types:
    - `antigravity` provider now uses `antigravity-accounts.json`.
    - `gemini-cli` provider now uses `gemini-cli-accounts.json`.
    - This ensures accounts are correctly separated and never mixed between providers.
- Refactored `AccountManager` to support parameterized storage files.
- Removed `account-check` command and associated tools.

## [0.0.0-cms-202601291945] - 2026-01-29

- Hide base Anthropic provider models in /models when an active Anthropic subscription account is present, preventing Claude Code-only credentials from being selected.

## [0.0.0-cms-202601291955] - 2026-01-29

- Fix Google API key accounts not injecting `apiKey` into provider options, preventing Gemini models from failing with missing key errors.

## [0.0.0-cms-202601292005] - 2026-01-29

- Globally filter out `gemini-embedding-001` across all provider variants to avoid listing non-chat embedding models.

## [0.0.0-cms-202601292015] - 2026-01-29

- Skip embedding models in /model-check so non-chat embeddings do not surface as health failures.

## [0.0.0-cms-202601300355] - 2026-01-30

- Lazy-load TUI commands in CLI and allow `OPENCODE_SKIP_TUI=1` so headless `model-check` can run without JSX runtime deps.

## [0.0.0-cms-202601291930] - 2026-01-29

- Restrict /models to show only the active subscription per provider family and label categories with the active owner id using accounts display-name logic.
- Hide unsupported Gemini embedding models from /models.

## [0.0.0-cms-202601291900] - 2026-01-29

- Fix Anthropic Claude Max OAuth flow by updating the built-in auth plugin and removing the incorrect OAuth block.
- Restore Anthropic provider UI copy to indicate Claude Max support alongside API keys.

## [0.0.0-cms-202601300230] - 2026-01-30

- Improved account management CLI:
    - Implemented JWT decoding for OpenAI and other subscription accounts to show real email addresses instead of UUIDs.
    - Added aggressive identifier discovery to prioritize human-readable names over generic IDs or UUIDs.
    - Implemented specific fallback mapping for Anthropic (`company@thesmart.cc`) and Opencode (`yeatsluo@gmail.com`) primary accounts.
    - Refactored removal hotkeys: switched from `backspace` to `x` and `delete` to prevent accidental deletions.
    - Simplified deletion confirmation dialog: any non-"Yes" input (including Escape or Cancel) now immediately cancels the action.
- Enhanced TUI stability:
    - Fixed a fatal crash (`undefined is not an object`) during TUI startup when agent or model data is not yet fully loaded.
    - Added optional chaining and safe fallbacks for agent name, color, and model accesses across prompt and agent dialog components.

## [0.0.0-cms-202601290930] - 2026-01-29

- Resiliency for sandboxed runs: `Global.Path` now validates that the configured XDG directories are writable, falls back to a local `.opencode-data` workspace root when they are not, and honors `OPENCODE_DATA_HOME` to pin the alternative location.

## [0.0.0-cms-202601290848] - 2026-01-29

- Fix `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_URL]` in Antigravity and Gemini-CLI plugins by properly handling relative API paths in the fetch interceptor.
- Implement a model ignore list to filter out unsupported, deprecated, or buggy models (e.g., direct Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet that fails with Claude Code credentials).
- Improve Antigravity request robustness by ensuring all intercepted URLs are absolute before processing.
- Preserve Claude-specific headers (`User-Agent`, `anthropic-client`) during fingerprint application to prevent authentication failures.

## [0.0.0-cms-202601290822] - 2026-01-29

- Fix Anthropic authentication issue for "Claude Code" credentials by adding `User-Agent` and `anthropic-client` headers.
- Fix `AI_InvalidPromptError` by updating `toModelMessages` to comply with standard AI SDK part formats (using `text` instead of `value`) and improving tool output conversion.

## [0.0.0-cms-202601290808] - 2026-01-29

- Planning to migrate raw branch customizations into cms (latest dev).
- Allow antigravity/gemini-cli providers even when enabled_providers is set to google, restoring account model checks.
- Add CLI model-check command registration and resilient logging to make cms dev mode runnable again.
