# OpenCode Project Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the `opencode` monorepo structure, detailing the various packages, their purposes, and relationships. It is intended to guide developers and AI agents in understanding the system's organization.

## Document Purpose & Maintenance Contract

This file is an **architecture state document**, not an event log.

1. **Primary purpose**
   - Record the **current architecture baseline** (what is true now).
   - Provide **high-signal file/module index summaries** for core runtime areas.

2. **What belongs here**
   - Stable architecture contracts, boundaries, invariants, and component responsibilities.
   - File-level summary/index updates when architecture-relevant code paths are added/changed.

3. **What does NOT belong here**
   - Chronological implementation diary, debug timeline, or step-by-step change history.
   - Temporary migration notes that are no longer part of current runtime truth.

4. **Where change history goes instead**
   - Use `docs/events/event_<YYYYMMDD>_<topic>.md` for decision trail, RCA, execution logs, and validation records.

5. **Update rule (mandatory)**
   - If a change affects architecture boundaries/contracts or adds/removes important runtime modules, update this document's relevant architecture section and/or file index summaries in the same task.

## Branching Strategy & Project Context

The project operates with a specific branching strategy that defines the architectural direction:

### `cms` Branch (Current Production Line)

The `cms` branch is the primary product line for this environment, featuring significant enhancements over the upstream `origin/dev`.

**Key Features of `cms`:**

1.  **Global Multi-Account Management**: A unified system for managing multiple provider accounts.
2.  **Rotation3D System**: A dynamic model switching and load balancing system (`rotation3d`), enabling high availability and rate limit management.
3.  **Admin Panel (`/admin`)**: A centralized "Three-in-One" management interface for system administration.
4.  **Provider Granularity**: The legacy monolithic `google` provider is canonically split into runtime families that maximize resource utilization:
    - `gemini-cli`: Optimized for batch processing and large context.
    - `google-api`: For lightweight, high-speed requests.
    - legacy aliases are not valid canonical runtime families.

### Upstream Integration

- **`origin/dev`**: The upstream source. Changes from `origin/dev` are **analyzed and refactored** before being integrated into `cms`. Direct merges are prohibited to preserve the `cms` architecture.
- **External Plugins**: Located in `/refs`, these are also subject to analysis and refactoring before integration.

### Cross-Surface Runtime Architecture (current state)

#### Web runtime boundaries

1. **Auth boundary (`WebAuth`)**
   - Browser uses cookie-session + CSRF protection.
   - CLI/TUI compatibility path can still use Basic auth where required.
   - CLI bearer-token requests are identity-bound: `Authorization: Bearer <OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN>` must include `x-opencode-user`.

2. **Instance boundary (`Instance.directory`)**
   - Request directory is canonically resolved server-side and echoed via `X-Opencode-Resolved-Directory`.
   - Relative directory overrides are resolved from authenticated user home; absolute paths are preserved (then validated for existence).
   - Directory override from request is only accepted on loopback, authenticated web mode, or explicit global browse enablement.

3. **PTY boundary (`/pty`)**
   - PTY sessions require explicit create → connect lifecycle.
   - Stale PTY ids are treated as invalid session state and must be recreated.

#### TUI/Web admin capability boundary

- **TUI `/admin`** is the canonical control plane for provider/account/model operations and rotation-aware diagnostics.
- **Web** provides an admin-lite model manager that reuses the same backend account/provider APIs, including provider visibility toggles plus account add/view/rename/delete/set-active flows inside `packages/app/src/components/dialog-select-model.tsx`.

#### Deployment/runtime consistency

- Docker web profile (`docker-compose.production.yml` + `Dockerfile.production`) follows the same `/opt/opencode` runtime contract as native environments.
- MCP runtime services are canonicalized under `packages/mcp/*`; `scripts/*` keeps compatibility shims only.

#### Web multi-user runtime architecture

1. **Service identity model**
   - `opencode-web.service` runs as a no-home service identity (`HOME=/nonexistent`).
   - Service binaries/wrappers are expected under `/usr/local/*`.

2. **Gateway + per-user daemon topology**
   - Gateway process serves web/auth/API entrypoints.
   - User-scoped runtime operations are routed to per-user daemon instances (`opencode-user-daemon@.service`) under authenticated Linux user context.

3. **Routed API policy**
   - Per-user-daemon routed APIs use strict no-fallback behavior: daemon path failure returns structured `503`.
   - This prevents mixed-source reads/writes across service-scope and user-scope runtime paths.

4. **Daemon-routed API domains**
   - Config APIs: read/update.
   - Account APIs: list + mutation routes.
   - Session APIs: list/read/status/top + mutation routes.
   - Model preference APIs: read/update.

5. **Web realtime behavior**
   - Primary path: SSE global events (`/global/event`) drive incremental UI updates.
   - Reliability fallback: while `session.status !== idle`, web periodically forces message snapshot hydration (`session.sync(..., { force: true })`) so assistant replies remain visible without page refresh if SSE propagation is delayed/dropped.
   - Prompt footer quota metadata is **not** driven by raw SSE deltas alone. For OpenAI usage, web uses a conditional refresh gate in `packages/app/src/components/prompt-input.tsx`: it refetches quota only when a new assistant turn completes **and** the previous quota refresh is older than 60 seconds **and** the effective provider family is `openai`.
   - This keeps footer usage reasonably fresh after real AI interaction while avoiding constant polling for idle pages or non-OpenAI providers.

6. **Runtime ownership target**
   - Runtime memory/history/config/state are owned by authenticated user home (`~/.config`, `~/.local/share`, `~/.local/state`).
   - Historical transition details and RCA remain in `docs/events/`.

7. **Review data-path observability contract (web)**
   - `GET /file/status` returns lightweight diagnostics headers:
     - `X-Opencode-Review-Directory`
     - `X-Opencode-Review-Count`
   - Deep diagnostics route `GET /experimental/review-checkpoint` is available only when `OPENCODE_DEBUG_REVIEW_CHECKPOINT=1`.

#### Capability registry contract

- Capability discovery source-of-truth is `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt/enablement.json` with template mirror at `templates/prompts/enablement.json`.
- Prompt/runtime routing should use this registry for tools/skills/MCP inventory and on-demand MCP lifecycle policy.

### Provider Identity & TUI Admin Runtime Architecture (cms)

This section defines the **authoritative** provider/account/model architecture for cms TUI `/admin` and backend runtime.
Historical change logs belong in `docs/events/`; this document keeps the current architecture only.

#### A) cms Provider Graph (authoritative coordinates)

The runtime must treat identities as explicit coordinates:

1. **Provider Family** (canonical): e.g. `nvidia`, `openai`, `gemini-cli`
2. **Account** (family-scoped): active + candidates in `accounts.json`
3. **Model** (provider-scoped): from models.dev/snapshot + config/plugin/custom loader overlays

No runtime decision should depend on "guessing" family from an arbitrary dashed provider string without canonical family inventory.

#### B) TUI `/admin` provider operation pipeline (cms)

| Stage                           | UI Component / Route                                                          | Runtime Side Effect                                                   |
| :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provider inventory bootstrap    | `tui/context/sync.tsx` (`provider.list`, `provider.auth`, `config.providers`) | Hydrates provider/auth/config state for admin menus                   |
| Add provider entry              | `dialog-admin.tsx` → `DialogProviderManualAdd`                                | Writes `config.provider[...]`, triggers sync bootstrap                |
| Add API key (models.dev family) | `DialogApiKeyAdd`                                                             | `Account.add(family, accountId, apiKey)` under canonical family scope |
| Add Google API account          | `DialogGoogleApiAdd`                                                          | Adds `google-api` account with explicit family key                    |
| OAuth account connect           | `DialogProvider` → `/provider/:id/oauth/*`                                    | Stores auth via `Auth.set(...)` / account module                      |
| Active account switch           | `/account/:family/active`                                                     | Rotation and model availability read new active account               |

#### B.1) Prompt footer quota/runtime metadata pipeline (TUI + Web)

This subsection documents how prompt footer usage/account metadata stays fresh without high CPU polling.

1. **TUI prompt footer orchestration**
   - Entry point: `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/component/prompt/index.tsx`
   - TUI computes footer metadata from current provider/model/account state and provider-specific quota hints.
   - OpenAI quota is loaded through a Solid `createResource(quotaRefresh, ...)` path (`codexQuota`).
   - Refresh is triggered by two low-cost signals:
     - **turn completion signal**: when `lastCompletedAssistant` changes, TUI increments `quotaRefresh`
     - **low-frequency timer**: footer tick refresh (default 15s via `OPENCODE_TUI_FOOTER_REFRESH_MS`)
   - Result: footer usage looks near-realtime after real assistant work, but avoids aggressive background polling.

2. **Web prompt footer orchestration**
   - Entry point: `packages/app/src/components/prompt-input.tsx`
   - Web prompt footer also derives metadata from current provider/account state, but OpenAI quota refresh is stricter than TUI for browser efficiency.
   - The web quota resource key is gated by `quotaRefresh` and only becomes active for `openai`.
   - Refresh policy is event-driven, not interval-driven:
     - wait for a **new completed assistant turn**
     - require **more than 60 seconds** since the previous quota refresh
     - require effective provider family = `openai`
   - Non-OpenAI providers do not participate in this refresh path.

3. **Shared OpenAI quota source-of-truth**
   - Canonical implementation: `packages/opencode/src/account/quota/openai.ts`
   - Responsibilities:
     - refresh expired Codex/OpenAI OAuth access tokens
     - call `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`
     - normalize usage windows into footer-friendly remaining percentages (`hourlyRemaining`, `weeklyRemaining`, `hasHourlyWindow`)
   - Backend route `packages/opencode/src/server/routes/account.ts` exposes `/account/quota` for web consumption.

4. **Caching / load-shedding contract**
   - OpenAI quota fetching uses in-process cache (`quotaCache`) with 5-minute TTL and stale-while-revalidate behavior.
   - This means UI-triggered refresh does **not** imply a guaranteed remote usage API call every time; cached quota may be served immediately while refresh happens only when stale.
   - Architectural goal: preserve operator-visible freshness after actual AI usage while keeping CPU/network cost bounded.

#### C) Backend provider graph assembly (canonical order)

`provider/provider.ts` state initialization is conceptually:

1. Load models registry (`models.dev` + snapshot) into provider database.
2. Apply provider-specific manual correction layer to raw model feeds (remove known-bad upstream entries, add curated missing entries).
3. Merge config providers and aliases.
4. Merge env/auth-derived provider options.
5. Merge account families (`Account.listAll`) into account-scoped provider entries.
6. Apply plugin/custom loaders.
7. Apply model/provider filtering (ignored/deprecated/disabled/rate-limit aware checks).

This order guarantees models are family-owned first, then account- and plugin-specific behavior is overlaid.

#### D) Family resolution and identity boundaries

To enforce 3D identity boundaries:

- Auth family resolution now uses canonical family inventory
  (`Account.PROVIDERS` + models.dev providers + existing account families), with deterministic resolution order:
  - exact family match
  - account-id pattern (`{family}-{api|subscription}-...`)
  - longest known family prefix
- Account load now normalizes legacy/non-canonical family keys (example: `nvidia-work` → `nvidia`) and preserves data during merge.
- Deprecated fallback behavior that treated arbitrary dashed IDs as valid family IDs was reduced.
- Canonical resolver API is now the primary runtime path:
  - `Account.resolveFamily(providerId)`
  - `Account.resolveFamilyOrSelf(providerId)`
- Family-level UI inventory is now separated from runtime account-scoped providers:
  - canonical UI family source: `packages/opencode/src/provider/canonical-family-source.ts`
  - current first consumer: TUI `/admin` root/provider list in `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/component/dialog-admin.tsx`
  - rule: UI provider lists consume canonical families only; account-scoped provider IDs remain internal runtime coordinates for account/model execution paths.
  - backend `/provider` route (`packages/opencode/src/server/routes/provider.ts`) now emits family-level provider rows from the same canonical source so web consumers can converge on the same provider family inventory.

#### D.1) Identity invariants (must hold)

1. **No fuzzy family parsing in runtime decisions**
   - Model routing, fallback, health checks, and provider route composition must use canonical resolver API.
2. **Family is canonical, account is scoped**
   - `provider-family` and `account-id` are distinct coordinates; account suffix strings are never treated as family source-of-truth.
3. **Storage self-heals legacy family keys**
   - On account load and explicit migration, non-canonical keys are normalized and merged without silent data loss.
4. **Operational migration is explicit**
   - `opencode auth migrate-identities` provides a reportable/manual path to normalize identity drift.

#### D.2) Refactor coverage and verification gates

This refactor is not limited to `Auth` or `Account`; canonical identity resolution was propagated to all major provider decision paths:

- Session model routing/fallback (`session/llm.ts`, `session/processor.ts`, `session/image-router.ts`)
- Provider health and availability checks (`provider/health.ts`)
- Provider API composition (`server/routes/provider.ts`)
- Rotation and scoring (`account/rotation3d.ts`, `agent/score.ts`)
- Runtime provider inheritance (`provider/provider.ts`) — legacy regex inheritance removed and replaced with resolver-based inheritance.

To prevent regressions for the original NVIDIA admin issue, the project now includes both test and script-level gates:

- Regression tests:
  - `packages/opencode/test/auth/family-resolution.test.ts`
  - `packages/opencode/test/account/family-normalization.test.ts`
  - `packages/opencode/test/provider/provider-cms.test.ts` (includes admin-like NVIDIA flow)
- Scripted E2E tester:
  - `scripts/test-e2e-provider-nvidia-admin.ts`
  - Verifies: add NVIDIA API account → activate account → provider model list visible → model resolvable
  - **Non-polluting cleanup guarantee**: tester always removes temporary `e2e-*` account and restores previous active account in `finally`.

#### Session page shell contract (`packages/app`)

The web session UI now uses a single canonical page shell centered on `packages/app/src/pages/session.tsx`.

1. **Single page implementation**
   - `pages/session.tsx` is the only authoritative session page implementation.
   - `pages/session/index.tsx` exists only as a forwarding compatibility module and must not carry its own page logic.

2. **Pane topology**
   - **Main conversation pane**: message timeline + prompt dock.
   - **File pane**: dedicated file-view surface for opened file tabs.
   - **Tool sidebar**: right-side tool surface for `changes`, `context`, `files`, and `status` modes.
   - **Terminal panel**: separate bottom panel; not merged into the right sidebar system.

3. **Canonical shell API**
   - `layout.view(sessionKey).filePane` is the canonical open/close/toggle API for the file-view pane.
   - `layout.view(sessionKey).reviewPanel` remains as a temporary compatibility alias only; new work should use `filePane`.

4. **Naming boundary**
   - Shell-layer naming distinguishes:
     - `filePane` = opened file viewer container
     - `changesPanel` = diff/review content rendered inside the tool sidebar
   - Domain-level review concepts such as `SessionReviewTab` and `commentOrigin: "review"` remain valid and were not renamed as part of shell cleanup.

### 4. Console Backend (`packages/console/core`)

## 12. Configuration & Provider State Architecture (Normative)

This section defines the authoritative behavior for runtime config and provider visibility in `cms`.

### A. Runtime Config Source of Truth

1. Runtime configuration for provider enable/disable is **global-scope only**.
2. Project-level `.opencode/opencode.json(c)` is **not part of runtime merge** in this build.
3. Admin/TUI mutations must write to global config via runtime-safe update flow.

**Primary files**

- `packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/context/sync.tsx`

### B. Provider State Semantics

1. `disabled` and `hidden` are the same product concept for provider visibility.
2. Provider visibility is controlled by `config.disabled_providers`.
3. Disabled providers are excluded from filtered provider list and shown in Show All as disabled.

**Primary files**

- `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/component/dialog-admin.tsx`
- `packages/opencode/src/provider/provider.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/plugin/index.ts`

### C. Admin Providers List Modes

1. **Filtered mode (default)**: show enabled providers only.
2. **Show All mode**: show full provider family set (enabled + disabled).
3. Both modes must use the same underlying provider universe; mode difference is filtering only.

### D. Toggle Behavior Contract

1. In provider root list, toggle action must update enable/disable state in both modes.
2. Root-level provider toggle uses `Space` as the canonical action; root `Delete` path is disabled/hidden.
3. Toggle success must update:
   - persisted config (`disabled_providers`)
   - in-memory runtime state
   - rendered list/status in current mode

### E. Event/Refresh Contract

1. After config mutation, instance disposal must complete before subsequent reads bootstrap new state.
2. TUI sync must refresh on:
   - `server.instance.disposed`
   - `global.disposed`

### F. Debugging Checklist (Provider Toggle)

If toast says success but UI does not change, verify in order:

1. `disabled_providers` actually changed in effective runtime config.
2. TUI sync received disposed event and re-bootstrapped state.
3. Provider list mode logic is filtering correctly (Show All vs filtered).
4. Status label and filter both read from the same disabled source.

## 13. Provider Toggle and Tool-Call Bridge Architecture

This section defines the current provider visibility/toggle architecture and tool-call bridge behavior for `/admin` and runtime provider normalization.

### A. Provider Toggle Behavior

1. Unified semantics:
   - `disable == hide`
   - `enable == show`
2. `Show All` is full list (no visibility filter).
3. `Filtered` mode only shows enabled providers.
4. Root-level provider toggle uses `Space` as primary action; root `Delete` path is disabled/hidden.

**Primary file**

- `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/component/dialog-admin.tsx`

### B. UX/State Consistency

1. Resolved stale/slow visual updates with optimistic provider-state updates.
2. Toggle success is reflected immediately in UI; persistence and bootstrap run in background.
3. Removed duplicate footer action label in root provider list.
4. Fixed `Show All` disappearing item regression after toggle.

### C. Config and Refresh Reliability

1. Runtime provider toggle writes through server global-config API path.
2. Post-update refresh chain is aligned with sync event handling.
3. TUI sync listens to both instance and global disposal events for refresh convergence.

**Primary files**

- `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/component/dialog-admin.tsx`
- `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/context/sync.tsx`
- `packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts`

### D. Guardrail

Any future provider-toggle refactor must preserve:

1. Single source for disabled state (`disabled_providers`).
2. `Show All`/`Filtered` list parity except filter.
3. Disabled Antigravity plugin path must not initialize auth plugin hooks.

### E. Tool Call Bridge Generalization

1. Response rewrite logic for text-protocol tool calls is now routed through a generic Tool Call Bridge manager.
2. Provider/model-specific matching (for example, GmiCloud DeepSeek) is isolated in bridge rule modules under `src/provider/toolcall-bridge/bridges/`.
3. Legacy compatibility exports are preserved via `src/provider/gmicloud-toolcall-bridge.ts` to avoid breaking existing call sites and tests.
4. The generic OpenAI chat rewriter and protocol parser are reusable for future providers that emit textual tool-call markers.

**Primary files**

- `packages/opencode/src/provider/provider.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/provider/toolcall-bridge/index.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/provider/toolcall-bridge/bridges/gmicloud-deepseek.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/provider/toolcall-bridge/openai-chat-rewriter.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/provider/toolcall-bridge/protocol/text-protocol.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/provider/gmicloud-toolcall-bridge.ts`
- `packages/opencode/test/provider/toolcall-bridge/manager.test.ts`

## 14. External Dependency Architecture

This section inventories current external dependency surfaces for the `cms` branch and clarifies where dependency resolution happens at runtime vs build time.

### A. Dependency Layers (Where dependencies are actually resolved)

1. **Monorepo build/install layer**
   - Source: root `package.json` + workspace package manifests.
   - Manager: Bun workspace (`workspaces`, `catalog`, `overrides`, `patchedDependencies`).
   - Resolution timing: `bun install` in repo.

2. **Runtime user-space layer (dynamic, outside repo)**
   - Source: user directories (`~/.config/opencode`, `~/.local/share/opencode`) and optional custom config dir.
   - Manager: `Config.installDependencies()` in `packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts`.
   - Resolution timing: during runtime bootstrap (tool/plugin loading flow), not only during repo development.

3. **Template bootstrap layer**
   - Source: `templates/package.json` and `.opencode/package.json` templates.
   - Purpose: define default runtime dependencies for initialized user environments.

### B. Monorepo External Dependency Profile (high-level)

1. **AI/provider SDK cluster (core runtime heavy coupling)**
   - Root depends on many provider adapters under `@ai-sdk/*` (Anthropic/OpenAI/Google/Bedrock/Groq/etc.) and MCP/ACP stacks.
   - Architectural implication: provider availability and transport compatibility are external-SDK sensitive.

2. **UI/desktop cluster**
   - `packages/app` depends on Solid ecosystem + rendering/markdown/highlight stack.
   - `packages/desktop` depends on Tauri plugin suite (`@tauri-apps/*`).
   - Architectural implication: desktop release stability is tied to Tauri plugin matrix compatibility.

3. **Console/backend cluster**
   - `packages/console/core` and `packages/console/function` depend on Drizzle/Postgres/Stripe/AWS/OpenAuth stacks.
   - Architectural implication: cloud/service API version drift can affect serverless and billing/auth flows.

4. **Dependency governance mechanisms already present**
   - `catalog:` centralizes many versions.
   - `overrides` pins critical transitive behavior.
   - `patchedDependencies` currently includes `ghostty-web@0.3.0` patch path.

### C. Runtime Dynamic Dependencies (hidden coupling hotspots)

1. **Auto-install path exists in runtime config pipeline**
   - `Config.state()` iterates runtime config directories and calls `installDependencies(dir)`.
   - `installDependencies()` rewrites/ensures `package.json` dependency:
     - `"@opencode-ai/plugin": targetVersion`
   - `targetVersion = Installation.isLocal() ? "*" : Installation.VERSION`.

2. **Version-coupling risk**
   - When `Installation.VERSION` is a custom/non-published build tag (e.g., `0.0.0-cms-*`), runtime install can fail because npm registry has no matching `@opencode-ai/plugin` release.
   - This is a runtime bootstrap coupling, not a monorepo compile-time failure.

3. **Current runtime manifests (observed)**
   - `~/.config/opencode/package.json`
   - `~/.local/share/opencode/package.json`
   - Both are active dependency manifests used by runtime bootstrap.

### D. Template & User-Space Dependency Surfaces

1. `templates/package.json`
   - Includes:
     - `@opencode-ai/plugin`
     - `opencode-openai-codex-auth-multi`
2. `.opencode/package.json` (repo template/runtime scaffold)
   - Includes floating `@opencode-ai/plugin: "*"`.

Architectural implication: user runtime behavior depends not only on repo lockfile, but also on template-emitted manifests and post-install mutation logic.

### E. Coupling Risk Classification (inventory only)

1. **High risk**
   - Runtime pinning of internal package to non-published version identifiers.
   - Floating `*` specifiers in runtime manifests.

2. **Medium risk**
   - Pre-release/timestamped package references (for example OpenAuth prerelease line).
   - URL-based package source in catalog (e.g. preview channel dependencies).

3. **Operational risk**
   - Runtime dependency state split across repo + user directories can produce environment-specific failures that are not reproducible from repo lockfile alone.

### F. Current Conclusion

The project has **three dependency planes** (monorepo, template, runtime user-space), and the most failure-prone area is the runtime plane where dependency versions are mutated during bootstrap. This is the primary external-coupling boundary to target in the next decoupling plan.

---

## 15. External Dependency Decoupling Plan (Draft v1)

This plan aims to reduce runtime dependency fragility while preserving compatibility for current users.

### A. Objectives

1. Eliminate runtime breakage caused by non-published internal package version pins.
2. Reduce hidden dependency drift between repo lockfile and user-space manifests.
3. Keep bootstrap behavior deterministic and diagnosable.

### B. Scope Boundaries

1. **In scope**
   - Runtime dependency installation policy in `Config.installDependencies()`.
   - Template/runtime manifest default version policy.
   - Health checks and telemetry for dependency resolution outcomes.

2. **Out of scope (for v1)**
   - Full removal of runtime plugin extensibility.
   - Re-architecting provider SDK selection model.

### C. Phased Rollout

#### Phase 0 — Safety Guard (Immediate, low risk)

1. Before writing runtime `@opencode-ai/plugin` version:
   - Validate target version format and publish availability.
2. If target is non-resolvable:
   - Fallback to a known-safe version policy (priority: template-pinned version -> latest stable allowed by policy).
3. Emit structured warning/event with cause and chosen fallback.

**Exit criteria**: no startup hard-fail caused by non-published plugin specifier.

#### Phase 1 — Version Source Decoupling (Short-term)

1. Stop direct coupling `pluginVersion := Installation.VERSION` for non-local channels.
2. Introduce explicit plugin resolution strategy:
   - `runtimePluginVersionPolicy` in config (e.g., `pinned`, `range`, `latest-safe`).
3. Resolve plugin version via policy module, not inline conditional.

**Exit criteria**: custom app version tags (`0.0.0-cms-*`) no longer imply same plugin version tag.

#### Phase 2 — Runtime Manifest Governance (Mid-term)

1. Replace floating `*` in runtime/template manifests with policy-driven ranges.
2. Add manifest provenance metadata (who/when/why updated dependency pins).
3. Add `opencode doctor deps` (or equivalent) to display effective dependency state across:
   - repo
   - global config dir
   - global data dir

**Exit criteria**: operators can inspect and reproduce dependency state deterministically.

#### Phase 3 — Optional Bundling / Offline Mode (Long-term)

1. Evaluate bundling core plugin runtime with application release artifact.
2. Keep external plugin install path only for explicitly opt-in custom plugins.
3. Add offline bootstrap path that does not require npm resolution for core runtime.

**Exit criteria**: baseline startup no longer depends on network package resolution for core plugin path.

### D. Policy Proposal (Version Resolution)

Resolution order for `@opencode-ai/plugin` during runtime install:

1. Explicit admin-managed override (managed config).
2. Explicit user config override.
3. Template baseline pinned version.
4. Registry-validated stable fallback.

Hard rules:

1. Never write unresolved/non-published exact version to runtime manifest.
2. Never persist `*` for core runtime dependency in production channels.
3. Record fallback decision in logs/events for auditability.

### E. Risk & Rollback Strategy

1. **Risk**: stricter policy may block previously tolerated custom pins.
   - Mitigation: provide explicit escape hatch config with warning banner.
2. **Risk**: compatibility drift between template version and runtime fallback.
   - Mitigation: CI check to compare template baseline against allowed policy set.
3. **Rollback**:
   - Feature-flag dependency policy module.
   - Revert to legacy install behavior behind emergency env flag.

### F. Validation Matrix

1. Local channel (`Installation.isLocal() = true`) bootstrap.
2. CMS custom version channel (`0.0.0-cms-*`) bootstrap.
3. Managed config override + read-only directory behavior.
4. No-network / registry timeout scenario.
5. Existing user manifests with historical invalid pins.

### G. Deliverables for Implementation Sprint

1. `DependencyVersionResolver` module + unit tests.
2. Runtime install guard in `Config.installDependencies()`.
3. Template manifest policy update.
4. Dependency health report command or admin diagnostics panel entry.

## 17. Runtime Dependency Principle (Normative, cms)

This section defines the dependency boundary policy for runtime behavior in `cms`.

### A. Core Principle

1. Runtime must minimize direct dependency on external package registries.
2. Public LLM provider APIs are an explicit exception (business-required external connectivity).
3. Non-LLM core runtime path must remain bootable under registry/network instability.

### B. Required Runtime Behavior

1. **Bundle-first for core runtime dependencies**
   - Core plugin/runtime capabilities should be loaded from release-bundled artifacts first.
2. **External-optional for non-core extensions**
   - External plugin installation is opt-in and must not block baseline startup.
3. **No runtime speculative version coupling**
   - Runtime install logic must not derive package versions directly from app build tags (for example `0.0.0-cms-*`).
4. **Deterministic fallback policy**
   - On unresolved external dependency, runtime must fallback/degrade with warnings, not hard-fail bootstrap.

### C. Ticket Alignment Update (v1 -> bundle-first)

1. `TKT-003` (manifest policy)
   - Upgrade target: remove floating `*` and mark core dependency path as bundle-first.
2. `TKT-004` (diagnostics)
   - Must classify dependencies as:
     - `core-bundled`
     - `external-optional`
     - `external-required`
3. Add implementation focus to `TKT-001/002`:
   - resolver/guard should prefer non-network core path before any external resolution.

### D. Success Criteria

1. Baseline runtime startup works when npm registry is unavailable (excluding first-time optional extension install).
2. Core agent/session/tool path does not require live dependency fetch.
3. Dependency failures in optional extensions are isolated and observable.

---

## 18. Test Governance Rule: Retire Obsolete Tests (Normative)

As `cms` architecture evolves, test maintenance must distinguish between regressions and obsolete contracts.

### A. Core Rule

If a test validates behavior that is intentionally removed by current architecture, that test should be **retired** (delete or move to legacy suite), not force-fixed.

### B. Retirement Decision Criteria

A test is eligible for retirement when all conditions hold:

1. The behavior is explicitly replaced/disabled in current architecture policy (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`) or recorded event decisions.
2. The test asserts legacy contract semantics that no longer represent production responsibilities.
3. Keeping the test causes persistent false alarms and reduces CI signal quality.

### C. Allowed Actions

1. **Delete** test if capability is permanently removed.
2. **Move to legacy suite** gated by explicit flag (e.g., compatibility verification only).
3. **Rewrite** test to validate the new contract if the capability still exists with changed semantics.

### D. PR/Review Requirements

When retiring tests, PR must include:

1. Reason for retirement mapped to architecture/event record.
2. Replacement coverage (if any) for current behavior.
3. Confirmation that CI signal quality improves (lower flaky/false-fail surface).

---

## 19. Web Auth Credential Management Baseline

This section defines the credential-management baseline for self-hosted Web deployments.

### A. Security Policy

1. Runtime credential strategy is selected by `OPENCODE_AUTH_MODE` (`pam`/`htpasswd`/`legacy`/`auto`).
2. Current cms baseline is **PAM-first** (`OPENCODE_AUTH_MODE=pam`) for Linux self-host deployments.
3. Keep htpasswd and legacy env-password as explicit compatibility modes, not implicit defaults.
4. Browser auth flow uses session cookie + CSRF protection; no URL-embedded basic credentials.

### B. Runtime credential behavior by mode

1. `pam`: Linux PAM only (`su` PTY via `bun-pty`); no htpasswd or legacy env password check.
2. `htpasswd`: file-based hash verification only (`OPENCODE_SERVER_HTPASSWD` or `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD_FILE`).
3. `legacy`: `OPENCODE_SERVER_USERNAME + OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` only.
4. `auto` (compatibility): htpasswd → legacy env password → PAM (Linux only).

### C. File-to-function mapping

## 20. WebApp File Structure & Runtime Flow (cms)

This section provides the current architecture view focused on:

1. where core WebApp logic lives, and
2. how the runtime data/auth/terminal flows operate end-to-end.

### A. WebApp structure map (high-signal paths)

### B. Runtime flow 1: Auth + API request path

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  B[Browser] --> C[AuthGate]
  C --> W[web-auth context\nauthorizedFetch + CSRF]
  W --> A[Server WebAuth middleware]
  A --> R[API routes /api/v2 + /global]
  R --> G[global-sdk/global-sync stores]
  G --> UI[Session + Settings UI]
```

Key contract:

- Browser path is cookie-session + CSRF.
- TUI/CLI compatibility may still use Basic auth where required.
- Pre-login event/SDK requests must be gated to avoid expected-but-noisy 401 loops.

### C. Runtime flow 2: Terminal / PTY lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  UI[Terminal UI] --> P1[POST /pty create]
  P1 --> P2[WS /pty/:id/connect]
  P2 --> BUF[Terminal renderer\ncontrol frame vs payload frame]
  BUF --> STORE[terminal context state]
  STORE --> UI
```

Required invariants:

1. PTY uses explicit create -> connect contract; stale IDs are invalid state.
2. Hydrated persisted PTY IDs must be validated/pruned on startup.
3. WebSocket handling must separate metadata control frames from renderable payload frames.
4. Popout/inline transitions use `skipRestore` policy to avoid stale-frame replay artifacts.

### C1. Workspace-scoped app state ownership (current beta/cms direction)

The web app currently uses a mixed ownership model while the new workspace kernel is being rolled out:

1. **Workspace-owned state**
   - `context/terminal.tsx`
   - `context/global-sync/child-store.ts`
   - These states now key off explicit workspace directory truth, not just raw route params.

2. **Session-with-workspace-default state**
   - `context/prompt.tsx`
   - `context/comments.tsx`
   - `context/file/view-cache.ts`
   - Rule: if a session id exists, keep per-session scope; otherwise fall back to the explicit workspace directory derived by `globalSync.child(directory).workspace`.

3. **Why this matters**
   - The app no longer treats every persistence surface as a plain directory string.
   - `global-sync` is now the first consumer-facing bridge between runtime workspace modeling and app-side persistence scope.
   - This is still an intermediate phase: runtime owns the canonical workspace kernel under `packages/opencode/src/project/workspace/*`, while app/runtime now share identity normalization via `@opencode-ai/util/workspace`.

### D. Runtime flow 3: Model selector and admin-lite parity path

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  S[DialogSelectModel] --> M[model-selector-state.ts]
  M --> PR[Provider rows]
  M --> AR[Account rows]
  M --> MR[Model rows]
  MR --> ACT[Apply: set active account -> set model]
  ACT --> SYNC[global dispose/bootstrap refresh]
```

Behavior boundary (current cms WebApp):

1. Provider/account rows derive from provider universe + account families.
2. Mode switch (`favorites`/`all`) affects model filtering layer only.
3. Unavailable/cooldown states are surfaced and selection is blocked with explicit reason.
4. Web has admin-lite parity slices; TUI `/admin` remains canonical full control plane.

### E. Deployment/runtime contract for WebApp correctness

1. Server should serve local frontend bundle via `OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH` for cms-consistent behavior.
2. If not set, CDN proxy fallback can produce frontend/runtime contract drift (auth and feature mismatch risk).
3. Operationally, direct web mode is primary for host-workspace parity; Docker remains optional isolation path.

## 21. Desktop Runtime Architecture

This section documents the desktop application's current operating principles. The desktop is a **thin Tauri shell** that loads the same web frontend served by `opencode serve`.

### A. Process Architecture (stdout-based sidecar)

```
Tauri Main Process (Rust, minimal)
  ├── Platform env setup (display backend, proxy bypass)
  ├── Spawns child: `opencode serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 [--port N]`
  │   with env: OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD={random UUID}
  │             OPENCODE_CLIENT=desktop
  │             OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH={bundled frontend resource}
  ├── Waits for stdout: "opencode server listening on http://..."
  │   (no HTTP health polling — parsed directly from stdout line)
  ├── Opens WebView → parsed server URL (External URL, not bundled HTML)
  │   with init script injecting auto-login credentials
  └── On exit: kill child process (RunEvent::Exit handler)

Child Process (Bun / opencode serve)
  ├── Hono HTTP server on localhost
  ├── API at /api/v2 and /
  ├── Frontend served from OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH (bundled in Tauri resources)
  └── SSE event stream at /event
```

**Port selection**: `OPENCODE_PORT` env → explicit `--port N` → port 0 (OS-assigned, reported via stdout).

**Readiness detection**: `cli.rs` reads the child's stdout line-by-line. When a line starts with `SERVER_READY_PREFIX` (`"opencode server listening on http://"`), the URL is parsed from that line and sent via a oneshot channel. Timeout: 30s → error dialog.

**Auto-login**: `windows.rs` injects `window.__OPENCODE__.autoLoginCredentials = { username, password }` via WebView initialization script. The web frontend's `AuthGate` component picks this up on mount and calls `auth.login()` automatically — no login form shown.

### B. Frontend Architecture (web-unified)

Desktop now loads the **same web frontend** (`packages/app/src/entry.tsx`) served by the opencode server, rather than a separate Tauri-specific entry. The WebView points to the server's HTTP URL (`WebviewUrl::External`).

**What this eliminates** (compared to the pre-refactor architecture):

- Desktop-specific `index.tsx` with 15+ Platform interface methods
- Separate Vite build for desktop frontend
- `bindings.ts` fragility (fewer Tauri commands called from frontend)
- Tauri plugins for: dialog, store, notification, clipboard, http

**What remains in Rust**:

- Window creation with server URL + auto-login injection
- Auto-updater (`tauri-plugin-updater`)
- Deep linking (`tauri-plugin-deep-link`)
- Single instance enforcement
- Window state persistence (`tauri-plugin-window-state`)
- Linux display backend configuration (`main.rs`)
- macOS traffic light + overlay title bar styling

### C. Frontend Serving & Runtime Config (Fail-Fast)

The web server frontend path (`server/app.ts`) follows a **fail-fast** contract:

1. Runtime must provide **`OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH`** (configured from `/etc/opencode/opencode.cfg` in webctl/systemd flows).
2. If frontend bundle path is missing/invalid, server returns explicit errors (`503/404/400`) — **no silent CDN fallback**.
3. For SPA routes, server serves local `index.html` from the configured frontend root.

Canonical runtime source of truth for web/server launch parameters:

- **`/etc/opencode/opencode.cfg`**
  - Examples: `OPENCODE_PORT`, `OPENCODE_HOSTNAME`, `OPENCODE_PUBLIC_URL`, `OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH`, auth-related env.

Canonical launch paths:

- **Dev**: `./webctl.sh dev-start` (reads `/etc/opencode/opencode.cfg`, injects `OPENCODE_LAUNCH_MODE=webctl`)
- **Prod**: `./webctl.sh web-start` (systemd service with `EnvironmentFile=/etc/opencode/opencode.cfg`, injects `OPENCODE_LAUNCH_MODE=systemd`)

Direct manual `opencode web` launch is guarded by launch-mode checks to prevent configuration drift.

**Desktop (Tauri)**: Bundles `packages/app/dist` as a Tauri resource at `frontend/`, sets `OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH` pointing to the resolved resource path at sidecar spawn time.

**Standalone CLI install** (`scripts/install/install`): Downloads `opencode-frontend.tar.gz` from the GitHub release and extracts to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/frontend/` for standalone distribution scenarios.

```
~/.local/share/opencode/
├── bin/opencode          ← CLI binary
├── frontend/             ← pre-built app dist (index.html, assets/, etc.)
│   ├── index.html
│   └── assets/
├── skills/               ← bundled skills
└── ...
```

### D. Initialization Flow (post-refactor)

1. **`main.rs`**: Set `NO_PROXY` for loopback; on Linux, configure display backend env vars.
2. **`lib.rs::run()`**: Register Tauri plugins + commands; spawn async `initialize()` task.
3. **`initialize()`**: Check for explicit port (`OPENCODE_PORT` or custom server URL) → spawn sidecar via `cli::serve()` → await stdout readiness signal → create `MainWindow` with `ServerReadyData { url, username, password }`.
4. **`MainWindow::create()`**: Build WebView with `WebviewUrl::External(server_url)`, inject auto-login credentials via initialization script.
5. **Web frontend `AuthGate`**: On mount, reads `window.__OPENCODE__.autoLoginCredentials`, calls `auth.login()`, renders app.

### E. Cross-Surface Comparison (TUI vs Web vs Desktop)

| Aspect              | TUI                                    | Web (`opencode web`)                                                           | Desktop (Tauri)                                   |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Server hosting      | In-process `Server.listen()` in worker | In-process `Server.listen()`                                                   | Separate child process (`opencode serve`)         |
| Frontend renderer   | Terminal (`@opentui/solid`)            | Browser (same-origin)                                                          | Tauri WebView (External URL to localhost)         |
| Frontend entry      | TUI-specific renderer                  | `packages/app/src/entry.tsx`                                                   | Same as web (served by child process)             |
| Auth model          | Env var password → in-process          | Cookie-session + CSRF                                                          | Auto-login via `window.__OPENCODE__` credentials  |
| Frontend resolution | N/A                                    | `OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH` (from `/etc/opencode/opencode.cfg`) → fail-fast error | Bundled Tauri resource → `OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH` |
| Process count       | 1 (main + worker thread)               | 1                                                                              | 2 (Tauri host + child)                            |
| Readiness detection | In-process (immediate)                 | In-process (immediate)                                                         | stdout line parsing (no HTTP polling)             |

### F. Platform-Specific Behavior

**Windows**:

- WebView2 custom data directory and proxy bypass for loopback (`--proxy-bypass-list=<-loopback>`).
- Overlay titlebar via `tauri-plugin-decorum`.

**macOS**:

- Private API enabled for improved scrolling (`macOSPrivateApi: true`).
- Overlay title bar with hidden title, traffic lights at `(12, 18)`.

**Linux / WSL**:

- WebKit env vars: `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER`, `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE`, `WEBKIT_FORCE_SANDBOX=0`, `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE`, `WEBKIT_DISABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS`.
- Wayland detection with X11 fallback (respects `OC_ALLOW_WAYLAND` and stored preference).
- GTK gesture zoom handler removal via `PinchZoomDisable` plugin.

## 22. System Identity & PAM Authentication Architecture

This section details the current Systemd-based user isolation, PAM authentication logic, and authorization bypasses (TUI) used to securely manage user identity impersonation while preserving single-user and local terminal workflows.

### A. Architectural Goals

1. **Strict User Isolation (Web):** A centralized system daemon (`opencode` service) hosts the web UI but spawns processes (like Bash shells or LLM scripts) under the explicitly authenticated Linux user's identity.
2. **Native Environment (TUI):** A terminal user launching the TUI must have requests run seamlessly under their _current session identity_, bypassing web auth flows without escalating or switching privileges.
3. **No Sudo for Opencode Core:** The main server runs as a less-privileged or dedicated `opencode` user and delegates command execution down to the target user via a narrowly-scoped sudoers policy.

### B. Core Components & Responsibilities

| File / Component                                  | Responsibility                                                                                                                          | Impact                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/opencode/src/system/linux-user-exec.ts` | **Execution Bridge:** Intercepts shell creation and command execution. Decides whether to prefix commands with `sudo -u <target_user>`. | Centralizes the decision point for user impersonation logic.                                                       |
| `packages/opencode/src/runtime/request-user.ts`   | **Context Manager:** Holds the `username` associated with the _current asynchronous request/call stack_.                                | Enables deep functions (like PTY spawners) to know who originated the HTTP request without prop drilling.          |
| `packages/opencode/src/server/web-auth.ts`        | **PAM Authenticator:** Validates credentials via Node-PAM. On success, issues a signed session cookie containing the `username`.        | The sole gatekeeper for browser-to-server trust. Extracts Linux user info and injects it into the request context. |
| `packages/opencode/src/server/app.ts`             | **Auth Middleware:** Rejects unauthenticated requests. Parses session cookies or bypass tokens and populates `RequestUser`.             | Secures all backend routes from unauthorized web access.                                                           |
| `scripts/opencode-run-as-user.sh`                 | **Sudo Target Script:** A restricted script that executes a payload as the target user while loading their `.bashrc` / `.bash_profile`. | Ensures the shell and agents have the correct environment variables (Node, Git, IDE settings) for that user.       |

### C. The TUI Auth Bypass (`OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN`)

Because the TUI acts as a client to the local server, pushing it through the web's PAM authentication would require prompt interruptions or manual password entries on an already-authenticated terminal.

To solve this securely:

1. **Dynamic Token Generation (`packages/opencode/src/index.ts`)**: When the CLI starts, it dynamically generates an `OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN` (random crypto bytes) and sets it in the environment variable.
2. **Worker Injection (`packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/thread.ts`)**: The TUI worker process inherits this variable.
3. **Authorized Fetches (`packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/worker.ts`)**: The TUI worker attaches `Bearer <OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN>` to its local server requests instead of standard auth credentials.
4. **Server Bypass (`packages/opencode/src/server/app.ts`)**: The server's middleware intercepts `OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN`. If it matches the server's running token, the request is permitted **without a `username` context**.

### D. Execution Decision Matrix

When `linux-user-exec.ts` (`resolveExecutionUser`) evaluates how to run a command:

| Auth Method                | Origin         | `RequestUser` Username | Sudo Execution Action                                        | Reason                                                                      |
| :------------------------- | :------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PAM Session Cookie**     | Browser WebApp | `<logged_in_user>`     | `sudo -u <user> /usr/local/libexec/opencode-run-as-user ...` | Explicit login requires isolating execution to the selected identity.       |
| **`OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN`**   | Local TUI      | `undefined`            | Native Execution (No Sudo)                                   | TUI is already running under the active terminal user's system permissions. |
| **No Auth (Public Route)** | Any            | `undefined`            | N/A (Denied by Server)                                       | Unauthenticated endpoints cannot trigger execution.                         |

### E. Security & Deployment Posture

- **Sudoers Policy:** For the WebApp impersonation to work, the daemon user (e.g., `opencode`) must be granted passwordless sudo access _only_ to the execution bridge script (`/usr/local/libexec/opencode-run-as-user`), not arbitrary commands.
- **Token Secrecy:** `OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN` only lives in volatile memory and the environment variables of child processes spawned by the immediate CLI invocation. It is never written to disk.
