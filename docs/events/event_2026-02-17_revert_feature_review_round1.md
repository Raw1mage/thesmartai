# Reverted feature commits review (round 1)

Date: 2026-02-17
Scope: `cms` branch reverted commits identified in 2026-02-01 ~ 2026-02-11 window.
Goal: Evaluate **behavioral value** vs **stability risk** before any re-apply.

## Decision table

| Revert commit | Original feature                                                    | Behavioral improvement                                                 | Current state on `cms`                                                                 | Recommendation                                                                    |

## Notes

- This review is behavior-oriented, not patch-oriented.
- Already-restored behaviors were detected in current code paths (provider connected footer, session footer, header version).
- High-risk areas for blind patching: rotation/error classification, desktop backend mode, and large UI style bundles.

## Execution updates (same day)

- Implemented: status dialog version display (`63cd76341` target behavior).
- Implemented: interactive `esc` dismiss affordance via shared `DialogDismiss` component (`32394b699` target behavior).
- Implemented: models.dev schema metadata on config model fields (`8c8d88814` target behavior with compatibility-preserving scope).
- Implemented: guarded favorite-model auto-cycle on rate-limit retry before opening admin dialog (`dc5b85188` target behavior, adapted to current code).
- Decision change for plugin exports (`c5dc075a8`): direct `dist` exports break monorepo typecheck; kept source exports and retained publish-time rewrite mechanism.
