# Event: Apply Patch Observability Planning

## Requirement

- User asked for an explanation of how `apply_patch` works because executions feel long and opaque.
- User identified the real issue as item 3: the expand control is ineffective before completion, so no running-state visibility exists.
- User then requested root-cause explanation plus the full remediation plan, and explicitly entered plan mode.

## Scope

### IN

- Trace the current `apply_patch` backend and TUI rendering pipeline.
- Define a build-ready plan to make `apply_patch` expandable and observable during running state.
- Produce aligned planner artifacts and modeling diagrams under `/plans/20260322_apply-patch-tool-tool-call/`.

### OUT

- Implementing the runtime change in this planning session.
- Generic redesign of all tool cards.
- Performance-only optimization without observability changes.

## Task List

- [x] Read architecture and current planning/event context.
- [x] Trace `apply_patch` backend execution and TUI render gating.
- [x] Confirm the root cause behind non-responsive pre-completion expand behavior.
- [x] Rewrite plan artifacts into an implementation-ready package.
- [x] Replace placeholder diagrams with task-specific models.

## Conversation Summary

- The user reported four symptoms, then narrowed the focus: duration is not the core problem; missing pre-completion expandability is.
- Initial analysis showed the running tool card stays on an inline fallback until `metadata.files` exists.
- The user selected two deliverables: root-cause explanation and a full remediation plan.
- After receiving the explanation, the user requested concrete implementation tasks and then entered plan mode.

## Debug Checkpoints

### Baseline

- Symptom: `apply_patch` appears static while running; the operator cannot open meaningful details until completion.
- Impact: subagent/orchestrator progress appears stalled because the UI exposes almost no execution evidence.

### Instrumentation Plan

- Read the TUI `ApplyPatch` renderer and the shared `ToolPart` metadata adapter.
- Read the backend `apply_patch` tool implementation to identify when metadata is created and returned.
- Compare the current behavior against an observable running-state model.

### Execution

- Confirmed `ToolPart` passes `props.part.state.metadata` for non-pending parts via `index.tsx:1430-1438`.
- Confirmed `ApplyPatch` in `index.tsx:2139-2235` renders `BlockTool` only when `props.metadata.files` is non-empty; otherwise it renders `InlineTool` with `Preparing apply_patch...`.
- Confirmed `packages/opencode/src/tool/apply_patch.ts:24-279` computes `fileChanges`, permission metadata, writes files, publishes file/bus events, runs `LSP.touchFile()` / `LSP.diagnostics()`, and only then returns final `metadata: { diff, files, diagnostics }`.
- Confirmed current plan package and modeling artifacts were still placeholders, then rewrote them into implementation-ready content for this feature.

### Root Cause

- The root cause is not simply runtime duration.
- The TUI expandability gate depends on `metadata.files.length > 0`, but the backend only provides `files` at the end of execution.
- Therefore, the running tool stays on a non-expandable inline placeholder throughout the long middle section, especially while writing files and awaiting diagnostics.

### Validation

- Planning validation confirmed the plan package now contains non-placeholder proposal/spec/design/tasks/handoff artifacts aligned to the observability problem.
- Diagram validation confirmed IDEF0/GRAFCET/C4/Sequence models now trace the apply_patch observability workflow rather than generic placeholders.
- Architecture Sync: Verified (No doc changes). This feature changes tool metadata and renderer behavior inside existing session-runtime boundaries without introducing a new long-lived module boundary.

## Remaining

- Formal promotion completed: the finished package is now recorded under `specs/apply-patch-observability/`.
- The dated active plan root can be removed as part of post-merge cleanup because this feature is now formalized.
