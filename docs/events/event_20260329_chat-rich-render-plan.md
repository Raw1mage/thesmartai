# Event Log

## Requirement

- Plan and implement a `/plans` package for improving chat output rendering and file display in the webapp.
- Reuse the existing file view/file tab surface so assistant file references can open files directly from chat.
- Upgrade markdown file viewing inside file tabs, with safe SVG and Mermaid handling.

## Requirement Update

- The user clarified that markdown file viewing inside file tabs is a current top priority, especially for `.md` documents with SVG and Mermaid-oriented content.
- The user selected a dual-track plan: markdown file viewing and chat file-link navigation should both be planned rather than forcing a single-track MVP ordering.
- The user further selected these concrete decisions for the first delivery:
  - `.md` file tabs use `Preview / Source`
  - SVG support is limited to `.svg` references, not inline raw SVG
  - chat file-link support is limited to `absolute path`, `repo-relative path`, and optional `:line`
  - Mermaid scope should aim broader than fenced-block-only, but safety and current renderer seams remain the hard limit

## Scope

### IN

- Markdown file-tab rendering and `Preview / Source`
- Chat file-reference parsing and navigation into existing file tabs
- Shared rich markdown surface for chat and file-tab preview
- Safe SVG and Mermaid handling within existing UI boundaries
- Planner artifacts, implementation evidence, and verification records

### OUT

- Repo-wide renderer rewrite
- Arbitrary raw HTML embedding
- Inline raw SVG execution
- Non-web surfaces unless required by shared renderer constraints

## Task List

- Read planner artifacts and architecture evidence
- Implement Markdown File Viewer MVP in beta worktree
- Implement Chat File-Reference Navigation MVP in beta worktree
- Unify chat/file-tab rich markdown surface in beta worktree
- Record verification blockers and sync docs in the main repo

## Conversation Summary

- The user clarified that markdown hyperlinks are desirable, but the real product goal is to make them actually render and interact correctly in the webapp.
- The user pointed out that the product already has a file view tab and suggested connecting assistant output to that surface before adding broader rendering support.
- Further inspection showed that chat messages already use `Markdown`, while file tabs still render markdown files through generic code output.
- Planning was therefore revised into a dual-track model: markdown file viewing and chat file-link navigation are parallel tracks, with shared renderer work and Mermaid/SVG following as controlled expansions.
- The user then approved moving into beta build workflow implementation.

## Debug Checkpoints

### Baseline

- Assistant replies already contain markdown-like structure and file references.
- Current user experience did not let those file references act as navigable UI elements.
- Existing webapp already provided file tabs and an SVG-aware file viewer.
- Markdown files in file tabs did not yet receive markdown-aware rendering.

### Instrumentation Plan

- Read session message renderer files to identify the current assistant text rendering seam.
- Read file context and file tab files to confirm file-open and selected-line authority surfaces.
- Read the rich-content provider to determine whether markdown extension should happen inside existing provider boundaries.
- Implement in beta worktree only, then validate with the smallest feasible package-level tests.

### Execution

- Confirmed `packages/app/src/pages/session/components/message-content.tsx` renders assistant text via `Markdown`.
- Confirmed `packages/app/src/pages/session/session-rich-content-provider.tsx` already wraps session UI with `MarkedProvider`, `DiffComponentProvider`, and `CodeComponentProvider`.
- Confirmed `packages/app/src/context/file.tsx` owns path normalization, loading, and selected-line state.
- Confirmed `packages/app/src/pages/session/file-tabs.tsx` already consumes selected lines and includes dedicated SVG preview behavior.
- Confirmed `packages/app/src/pages/session/file-tabs.tsx` previously routed generic loaded text, including markdown files, through `renderCode(...)` rather than a markdown-aware viewer branch.
- Implemented Markdown File Viewer MVP in beta worktree:
  - `.md`-specific viewer branch
  - `Preview / Source` toggle
  - markdown helper extraction
  - `.svg` reference rewriting/preload path
  - Mermaid detection with explicit visible fallback
- Implemented Chat File-Reference Navigation MVP in beta worktree:
  - conservative file-reference detection
  - `absolute path`, `repo-relative path`, optional `:line`
  - custom `opencode-file://` href encoding/decoding
  - click opens existing file tab and sets selected line
  - external URLs remain browser links
- Implemented shared rich markdown surface in beta worktree:
  - new `rich-markdown-surface.tsx`
  - chat and markdown file preview both route through the shared surface
  - Mermaid fallback notice centralized instead of duplicated

### Root Cause

- The missing capability was not the absence of a file viewer; it was the lack of binding between assistant message rendering and the existing file-navigation authority.
- Rich markdown support was asymmetrical: chat already had a markdown renderer, while markdown files in file tabs did not.
- The system also lacked a shared rich markdown surface, so chat and file-tab preview had duplicated and inconsistent behavior.

### Validation

- Beta branch used: `feature/chat-rich-file-rendering`
- Beta worktree used: `/home/pkcs12/projects/.beta-worktrees/opencode/feature/chat-rich-file-rendering`
- Re-ran the minimal feature tests directly in the beta worktree:
  - `bun test packages/app/src/pages/session/message-file-links.test.ts packages/app/src/pages/session/markdown-file-viewer.test.ts`
  - Result: **13 pass / 0 fail**
- Environment evidence now shows the earlier dependency-resolution blocker is no longer the active issue for the feature slice under test:
  - beta worktree resolves `node_modules` through the main repo dependency tree
  - `zod` resolves successfully from the shared dependency tree
  - `@happy-dom/global-registrator` is still absent, but it is not required by these two target tests
- Ran a broader `packages/app/src/pages/session`-focused test set for surrounding regression evidence:
  - Result: **56 pass / 2 skip / 5 fail / 2 errors**
  - Failing tests currently point to pre-existing or adjacent session test/environment debt rather than a direct regression in the rich-file feature slice:
    - `packages/app/src/pages/session/file-tab-scroll.test.ts` → `CSS is not defined`
    - `packages/app/src/pages/session/helpers.test.ts` → stale expectation still asserts `Model auto` instead of `Auto`
    - `packages/app/src/pages/session/scroll-spy.test.ts` → `document is not defined`
    - `packages/app/src/pages/session/__tests__/use-session-backfill.test.ts` → `window is not defined`
    - `packages/app/src/pages/session/__tests__/use-session-hash-scroll.test.ts` → `window is not defined`
- Current validation conclusion:
  - helper-level coverage for file-link parsing and markdown-file helper behavior is passing
  - there is still a coverage gap for direct integration around `packages/app/src/pages/session/file-tabs.tsx` and `packages/app/src/pages/session/components/message-content.tsx`
  - the feature is therefore partially validated, but not yet proven safe-to-ship at full UI integration depth
  - the user later explicitly chose to skip further test expansion for now and prioritize dirty-worktree convergence instead

## Decisions

- Treat markdown file viewing and chat file-link navigation as dual-track top-level workstreams.
- Preserve the current markdown path and extend it rather than replacing it.
- Add a markdown-aware branch to file tabs instead of leaving `.md` files on the generic code path.
- Use `Preview / Source` for markdown file tabs.
- Keep SVG rich behavior authoritative in the existing file viewer; support `.svg` references but not inline raw SVG.
- Keep chat file-link parsing conservative.
- Keep external URLs as normal browser links.
- Keep Mermaid in a safe explicit fallback state until a safe true-render path is verified.
- Per user instruction, stop after the current validation evidence and skip any further test work in this pass; prioritize dirty-change convergence instead.

## Verification

- Read `/home/pkcs12/projects/opencode/packages/app/src/pages/session/components/message-content.tsx`
- Read `/home/pkcs12/projects/opencode/packages/app/src/pages/session/session-rich-content-provider.tsx`
- Read `/home/pkcs12/projects/opencode/packages/app/src/context/file.tsx`
- Read `/home/pkcs12/projects/opencode/packages/app/src/pages/session/file-tabs.tsx`
- Read `/home/pkcs12/projects/opencode/specs/architecture.md`
- Checked beta worktree status to confirm modified/new files are within the expected session UI surface
- Re-ran beta worktree tests for `message-file-links.test.ts` and `markdown-file-viewer.test.ts`
- Ran a broader `packages/app/src/pages/session`-focused test slice to separate feature evidence from pre-existing session test debt
- Confirmed later dirty convergence left the beta worktree clean while main repo retained only documentation-side updates for this task

## Architecture Sync

- Verified (No doc changes): `specs/architecture.md` already reflects the shared rich-markdown surface between chat and markdown file preview, and already documents that markdown file tabs diverge from the generic `renderCode(...)` path.
