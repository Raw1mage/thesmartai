# Handoff

## Execution Contract

- Build/implementation agent must read `implementation-spec.md` first.
- Build/implementation agent must read `tasks.md` before coding.
- Runtime todo must be materialized from `tasks.md` before execution continues.
- Build/implementation agent must not resume from discussion memory alone when this plan package is available.
- User-visible progress and decision prompts must reuse the same planner-derived todo naming.

## Required Reads

- `proposal.md` (including original requirement wording, revision history, and effective requirement description)
- `spec.md`
- `design.md`
- `implementation-spec.md`
- `tasks.md`

## Stop Gates In Force

- Preserve approval, decision, and blocker gates from `implementation-spec.md`.
- Return to plan mode before coding if a new implementation slice is not represented in planner artifacts.
- Do not create a brand-new sibling plan unless the user explicitly requests it, or explicitly approves an assistant proposal to branch.

## Execution-Ready Checklist

- [x] Implementation spec is complete
- [x] Companion artifacts are aligned
- [x] Validation plan is explicit
- [x] Runtime todo seed is present in `tasks.md`

## Completion / Retrospective Contract

- Review implementation against the proposal's effective requirement description.
- Generate a validation checklist derived from `tasks.md`, runtime todo outcomes, implementation results, and executed validations.
- Report requirement coverage, partial fulfillment, deferred items, and remaining gaps as concise review output.
- Do not expose raw internal chain-of-thought; expose only auditable conclusions and evidence.

### Traceability Notes

- `A1 -> A11 -> A111` is the primary builder-first path because telemetry must exist before optimization decisions are made.
- `A2/A3/A4` are first-level sibling responsibilities, not replacements for the `A1` main build path.
- `A12` and `A13` consume the telemetry backbone rather than replace it.
- Builder implementation order: `A111/A112` → `A113/A114` → `A12` → `A13`.

## Build Validation Checklist

- [x] Effective requirements mapped to slices
- [x] Builder-first path explicitly defined
- [x] True three-level hierarchy present (`A1 -> A11 -> A111`)
- [x] Validation plan mapped to diagram nodes
- [x] Traceability matrix covers top-level and decomposed nodes
- [x] Build entry order documented

## Current Build Status

- Slice B telemetry backbone is implemented in beta repo and has passed focused validation for touched files.
- A113 benchmark procedure is now specified in `telemetry-benchmark.md`, and the first real short-session baseline dataset has been captured via persisted runtime telemetry.
- A114 validation gates are now specified in `telemetry-validation-gates.md`; Gate 4 is complete, while Gate 5 remains pending until first after-change benchmark evidence exists.
- Remaining builder path after current slice: `A113` Compare Benchmark Sessions → `A114` Check Validation Gates → `A12` Govern Prompt Context → `A13` Surface Context State.
- Cross-boundary subagent delegation remains an independent RCA/design track documented in `/home/pkcs12/projects/opencode-beta/docs/events/event_20260320_subagent_cross_boundary_rca.md` and is not a blocker for continuing telemetry work inside beta repo.

## Validation

- Architecture Sync: Verified (No doc changes)
  - Basis: handoff contract changed only in workstream status wording; long-term architecture boundaries remain unchanged.
