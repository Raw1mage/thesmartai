# Handoff: openclaw_reproduction

## Execution Contract

- `openclaw_reproduction` is the single active planning authority for OpenClaw-aligned runner evolution.
- Use benchmark conclusions and implementation slices from this package together; do not bounce between older `openclaw*` packages as if they were co-equal active plans.
- `specs/20260316_kill-switch/` is the implementation detail reference for kill-switch work; authority remains here.
- Build agent must read `tasks.md` before coding; runtime todo must be materialized from `tasks.md` before execution continues.
- Build agent must not resume from discussion memory alone when this plan package is available.
- User-visible progress and decision prompts must reuse the same planner-derived todo naming.

## Required Reads

- `proposal.md` — requirement wording, revision history, effective requirements, scope
- `spec.md` — GIVEN/WHEN/THEN structured requirements for all slices
- `design.md` — architecture decisions, state model, control protocol, pending design decisions
- `implementation-spec.md` — phased execution plan with stop gates and validation
- `tasks.md` — canonical task list with completion status
- `specs/20260316_kill-switch/` — kill-switch implementation detail specs (control-protocol, rbac-hooks, snapshot-orchestration)

## Stop Gates In Force

1. ~~**No production API without security sign-off**~~ — **CLEARED** (2026-03-16, approved by project owner)
2. **No build beyond Trigger + Queue** without explicit user approval for Phases 5-6
3. **No D.1-D.3 build** without explicit approval — specs expanded (2026-03-17), awaiting build approval
4. **No silent fallback** or implicit authority recovery in any implementation
5. **No multi-authority plan drift** — if a new sibling plan is needed, user must explicitly approve
6. **Preserve gate semantics** — trigger/queue abstraction must not break approved mission / approval / decision gates

## Build Entry Recommendation

- **All phases through Stage 3 complete** — Phases 0-6 + D.1-D.3 delivered (93/101 tests passing across 13 test files)
- **Remaining**: D.3.10 retry policy + aws4fetch lazy import tech debt
- **Next milestone**: merge `openclaw` → `cms`, then new spec for recurring scheduler persistence

### Short-term (D.3.10 + tech debt)

1. ~~**D.3.10 Retry Policy**~~ — **done** — `cron/retry.ts`, 20 tests
2. ~~**aws4fetch lazy import**~~ — **done** — `killswitch/service.ts` uses `await import("aws4fetch")` + `client.sign()` instead of `client.fetch()` (fixes hang bug)
3. **heartbeat integration test** — can now import real modules since aws4fetch is lazy

### Mid-term (merge + new spec)

1. Merge `openclaw` branch → `main` (resolve conflicts)
2. Open new spec: `specs/YYYYMMDD_recurring-scheduler-persistence/` — cron job persistence across restart, SQLite or file store
3. Resolve DD-2/DD-3 formally (both effectively resolved — MFA reuses existing system, snapshot uses fixed soft_timeout)

## Resolved Design Decisions

| ID | Decision | Resolution | Rationale |
|----|----------|------------|-----------|
| DD-1 | Real-time status push mechanism | **SSE** | Codebase 100% SSE-native（streamSSE from Hono），zero WebSocket infrastructure。複用現有 Bus → SSE → event-reducer pipeline |

## Pending Design Decisions

None — all design decisions resolved.

| ID | Decision | Resolution | Rationale |
|----|----------|------------|-----------|
| DD-2 | MFA integration approach | **Reuse existing** | Phase 4 security sign-off confirmed existing MFA system sufficient |
| DD-3 | Snapshot timing vs hard-kill window | **Fixed soft_timeout** | Phase 4 E2E tests validated fixed-window approach; dynamic extension deferred as non-critical |

## Historical Note

- This consolidated plan supersedes the earlier split between benchmark-only planning and scheduler-substrate planning.

  - `specs/20260315_openspec-like-planner/` — planner hardening + web-monitor-restart-control
  - `specs/20260315_autorunner/` — planner/runner/bootstrap contract rewrite
  - `specs/20260315_easier_plan_mode/` — plan/build mode semantics

## Completion / Retrospective Contract

- Review implementation against the proposal's effective requirement description.
- Generate a validation checklist derived from `tasks.md`, runtime todo outcomes, implementation results, and executed validations.
- Report requirement coverage, partial fulfillment, deferred items, and remaining gaps as concise review output.
- Do not expose raw internal chain-of-thought; expose only auditable conclusions and evidence.
