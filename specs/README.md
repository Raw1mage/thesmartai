# opencode specs/ — product wiki

This directory used to hold plan-builder spec packages (`<slug>/proposal.md`,
`design.md`, `tasks.md`, `.state.json`, …). It has been converted into a
**descriptive product wiki** — the source of truth for each entry is the
**current code**, not a forward-looking plan. The 41 original spec
packages were merged into 11 wiki entries by topic, with the originals
preserved under `_archive/` for history.

## Index / cross-cutting

- [architecture.md](./architecture.md) — cross-cutting architecture document.
  Per-feature detail lives in the wiki entries above; this remains the
  high-level index and decision-log narrative.

## Archive

- [_archive/](./_archive/) — the original 41 plan-builder spec packages,
  preserved verbatim. Historical references in `architecture.md`,
  `docs/events/**`, and inside the archive cross-link via
  `specs/_archive/<slug>/...`.

## Conventions for new entries

- Source of truth = the code, not the plan.
- Structure: `# topic` → blockquote naming source folders / scope →
  `## Status` → `## Current behavior` → `## Code anchors` → `## Notes`.
- No `proposal.md / design.md / tasks.md / .state.json` artefacts. If a
  new plan is in flight, run plan-builder under a separate folder
  (e.g. `_active/<slug>/`) and fold the result back into the relevant
  wiki entry on `living`.
- Cross-link freely between entries; treat the wiki as a graph.
