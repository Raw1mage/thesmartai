# Tasks — question-tool-abort-fix

## 1. Server Foundation — AbortSignal on Question.ask (Requirement A)

- [x] 1.1 Extend `Question.ask` signature to accept optional `abort?: AbortSignal`
- [x] 1.2 Store `dispose` handler on `pending[id]`; run on reply/reject/abort paths
- [x] 1.3 Implement abort listener: delete pending + `Bus.publish(Event.Rejected)` + reject promise with `RejectedError`
- [x] 1.4 Handle pre-aborted signal: short-circuit, no `question.asked` publish
- [x] 1.5 Add `log.info("aborted", { id, reason })` reading `signal.reason`
- [x] 1.6 Update `tool/question.ts` to pass `ctx.abort` into `Question.ask`
- [x] 1.7 Unit tests: stream-abort, late-abort (reply wins), pre-aborted signal, double-trigger idempotency

## 2. Server Telemetry — Cancel Reason (Requirement C)

- [x] 2.1 Define `CancelReason` union type in `prompt-runtime.ts` (added `parent-abort` beyond original spec after surveying task.ts cascade sites)
- [x] 2.2 Change `prompt-runtime.cancel(sessionID)` → `cancel(sessionID, reason: CancelReason)` (required arg)
- [x] 2.3 Pass reason into `controller.abort(reason)` in cancel / cleanupState / replace paths
- [x] 2.4 Add caller-stack-top log: `log.info("cancel", { sessionID, reason, caller })` using `new Error().stack`
- [x] 2.5 Update `SessionPrompt.cancel` wrapper to take + forward reason (stopReason workflow value remains `manual_interrupt` to preserve NON_RESUMABLE_WAITING_REASONS gate)
- [x] 2.6 Update all call sites:
  - [x] 2.6.1 `server/routes/session.ts` `/session/:id/abort` → `"manual-stop"`
  - [x] 2.6.2 `server/routes/session.ts` `/session/abort-all` → `"manual-stop"`
  - ~~[-] 2.6.3 processor rate-limit rotation abort~~ cancelled: processor.ts rotation uses `continue` (error-driven loop restart), does not invoke `SessionPrompt.cancel`. If the target bug turns out to be triggered here, we add it in a later amend with a new `"stream-error-restart"` reason value.
  - [x] 2.6.4 `prompt-runtime.ts` `start({ replace: true })` internal abort → `"replace"`
  - [x] 2.6.5 `prompt-runtime.ts` `cleanupState` per-session abort → `"instance-dispose"`
  - ~~[-] 2.6.6 session monitor / watchdog aborts~~ cancelled: `session/monitor.ts` grep for `cancel|abort` returns no hits; monitor does not call cancel today.
  - ~~[-] 2.6.7 ACP `session.abort` caller~~ cancelled: ACP calls the HTTP route, which is already wired via 2.6.1 → `"manual-stop"`.
  - [x] 2.6.8 `cli/cmd/session.ts` SIGTERM/SIGINT cleanup → `"manual-stop"` (found during survey)
  - [x] 2.6.9 `cli/cmd/session.ts` worker cancel msg → `"manual-stop"`
  - [x] 2.6.10 `tool/task.ts` subagent parent-abort cascade → `"parent-abort"` (both sites)
  - [x] 2.6.11 `server/killswitch/service.ts` all cancel paths → `"killswitch"`
- [x] 2.7 TypeScript tsc pass: no new errors on touched files; `bun test src/question/ src/session/prompt-runtime.test.ts` → 7/7 pass

## 3. Webapp — Content-hashed QuestionDock Cache (Requirement B)

- [x] 3.1 Add canonical JSON serializer (key-sorted recursive) helper → `question-cache-key.ts::canonicalJson`
- [x] 3.2 Hash helper: FNV-1a 32-bit sync (DD-2 amended from SHA-1 async to avoid createStore init race — see design.md)
- [x] 3.3 Cache key = `${sessionID}:${fnv1a32(canonicalJson(questions))}` replacing `request.id`
- [x] 3.4 `cacheKey` memoized via `createMemo`; sync, no async resolve races
- [x] 3.5 `cache.get(cacheKey())` lookup at `createStore` init path
- [x] 3.6 `cache.delete(cacheKey())` on replied=true path (reply + reject both)
- [x] 3.7 `onCleanup` writes `cache.set(cacheKey(), snapshot)` only when not replied
- [x] 3.8 Unit tests: 13 pass covering canonicalJson (4) + fnv1a32 (3) + questionCacheKey (6 — TV4/TV5/TV6 + option order + key order insensitive + flags). Full app suite 370/373 (3 skip) still green, no regression.

## 4. Docs & SSOT Sync

- [x] 4.1 Append `## Question Tool Abort Lifecycle` section to `specs/architecture.md`
- [x] 4.2 Event log `docs/events/event_2026-04-19_question-abort-fix.md` kept current through Phase 1/2/3 (bug chain + DD-1..DD-5 + phase summaries)
- [x] 4.3 Update `AGENTS.md` Enablement Registry → skipped (no new LLM-exposed capability)
- [x] 4.4 Updated `design.md` Critical Files to include Phase-2 survey-discovered call sites (cli/cmd/session.ts, tool/task.ts, server/killswitch/service.ts) and marked processor.ts/monitor.ts explicitly as "not changed"

## 5. E2E Validation

- [x] 5.1 Happy path regression via unit tests: `Question.ask` without abort → reply still resolves (backward-compat test case in index.test.ts)
- [x] 5.2 Bug reproduction path — user authorized merge 2026-04-19 after E2E. Unit test TV1 covers auto-reject semantics on the server side.
- [x] 5.3 AI re-ask cache restore — user authorized merge after E2E. Unit test TV4 proves identical content on same session produces identical cache keys.
- [x] 5.4 Manual Stop path log verification — user authorized merge; telemetry is ready for grep via `"reason":"manual-stop"` when the first real manual stop occurs.
- [x] 5.5 No duplicate `question.rejected`: covered by index.test.ts "late abort after reply" (TV2) and "abort dispatched twice" idempotency tests.
- [x] 5.6 `bun test packages/opencode/src/question/` → 6/6 pass. `bun test src/session/prompt-runtime.test.ts src/session/todo.test.ts` → 21/21 pass (with question suite). Full app suite 370/373 (3 pre-existing skip). `tsc --noEmit` has no new errors on touched files; pre-existing errors in unrelated lines (routes/session.ts:2167+, task.ts:283+) are not caused by this change.

## 6. Finalize

- [x] 6.1 Stage changes with explicit file list (no `git add -A`) — done across all Phase commits 9b21e8042..cd62bdea5 (rebased)
- [x] 6.2 Commits include spec slug + DD references across 6 commits (rebased: 3990c624b..cd62bdea5)
- [x] 6.3 Promote `implementing` → `verified` once tasks 1–5 checked + handoff.md validation evidence filled
- [x] 6.4 Promote `verified` → `living` once merged to main

## 7. Followups (tracked, scheduled for future amend / extend / new-spec runs)

- [ ] 7.1 TUI `cli/cmd/tui/routes/session/question.tsx` — add cache parity matching webapp's DD-2 v2 (sessionID + canonical FNV-1a). Explicitly deferred from this spec's OUT scope; open a follow-up plan-builder `extend` when picked up.
- [ ] 7.2 If production telemetry later shows `reason=rate-limit-fallback` aborts (currently no caller emits this), amend processor rotation path to carry the reason at the abort boundary, and update `design.md` DD-3.
- [ ] 7.3 If lazy-loaded tool schema-miss red boxes become a recurring UX complaint, open a new spec `tool-schema-lenient` to generalize the `apply_patch` passthrough + resolver pattern to the `question` tool and other commonly-lazy-loaded tools (flagged in user feedback 2026-04-19 screenshot).
- [ ] 7.4 Monitor `session.monitor` evolution — if it gains a watchdog cancel path, wire `"monitor-watchdog"` reason (enum value is already reserved).
