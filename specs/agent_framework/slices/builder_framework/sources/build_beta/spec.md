# Spec

## Purpose

- Define how the existing builder enters and executes beta-aware build mode without losing current capabilities, using deterministic builder-owned beta primitives for routine orchestration and keeping AI focused on implementation and judgment-heavy work.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Plan enter SHALL not blindly overwrite existing planner roots

The system SHALL refuse to blindly reinitialize planner artifacts when an existing planner root contains non-template or partial real content.

#### Scenario: implementation spec missing but other planner artifacts contain real content

- **GIVEN** the resolved planner root already contains proposal/design/tasks/handoff or diagrams with non-template content
- **WHEN** `plan_enter` is invoked
- **THEN** the system SHALL reuse or explicitly block the root instead of blindly rewriting the artifact set from templates

#### Scenario: brand new planner root has no meaningful content

- **GIVEN** the resolved planner root does not yet contain meaningful planner artifacts
- **WHEN** `plan_enter` is invoked
- **THEN** the system MAY initialize the artifact set from templates

### Requirement: Planner documents SHALL always be stored in the main repo

The system SHALL treat the authoritative main repo/worktree as the only valid storage location for planner/spec/event documents.

#### Scenario: planning is triggered while current worktree is beta

- **GIVEN** the current execution surface is a beta branch/worktree created for isolated build execution
- **WHEN** planning mode is requested
- **THEN** the system SHALL store `/plans`, `/specs`, and `docs/events` updates in the authoritative main repo/worktree instead of creating or modifying branch-local planner documents in the beta worktree

#### Scenario: planner document path resolves into beta worktree

- **GIVEN** planning is in progress and the resolved planner/spec/event write target would land inside a beta worktree
- **WHEN** the write is about to happen
- **THEN** the system SHALL block or reroute the write to the authoritative main repo/worktree before proceeding

### Requirement: Existing builder SHALL preserve current non-beta behavior

The system SHALL optimize the current builder flow without regressing approved non-beta build behavior.

#### Scenario: ordinary build plan without beta workflow

- **GIVEN** an approved plan that does not declare beta-loop execution intent
- **WHEN** `plan_exit` is invoked and builder enters build mode
- **THEN** the existing builder lifecycle SHALL continue to work with compatible behavior and without requiring beta-specific actions

### Requirement: Builder SHALL bootstrap beta execution on approved build entry

The system SHALL allow the existing builder to enter build mode through beta-loop bootstrap metadata and deterministic builder-owned orchestration.

#### Scenario: plan_exit approval with beta-loop-enabled plan

- **GIVEN** planner artifacts are complete and the approved plan declares beta-loop execution intent
- **WHEN** `plan_exit` is invoked and the operator answers Yes
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL resolve beta context, create or reuse the beta loop through builder-owned orchestration, materialize build todos, and emit build-mode handoff metadata containing beta execution context

#### Scenario: beta bootstrap requires explicit decision

- **GIVEN** `plan_exit` is preparing beta bootstrap but branch name or runtime policy is ambiguous
- **WHEN** builder-owned beta orchestration cannot resolve the required context safely
- **THEN** the system SHALL stop and require bounded clarification instead of entering build mode with guessed values

### Requirement: Builder SHALL validate through syncback semantics

The system SHALL support validation-phase syncback from beta execution into the main worktree using planner-approved runtime policy.

#### Scenario: validation step requests runtime refresh

- **GIVEN** build mode is executing a beta-loop-enabled plan and reaches a validation step
- **WHEN** validation requires the main runtime surface to reflect the feature branch
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL perform syncback-equivalent checkout behavior and invoke runtime start/refresh according to the resolved policy

#### Scenario: routine git operations are needed during build

- **GIVEN** build mode is executing on the beta branch and requires routine git progress operations
- **WHEN** branch checkout, commit, push, or pull are required by the approved workflow and policy allows them
- **THEN** the builder SHALL perform them through deterministic built-in flow instead of requiring repeated user prompts for those steps

#### Scenario: bootstrap rejects dirty mainline state

- **GIVEN** the main worktree contains uncommitted changes
- **WHEN** builder attempts beta bootstrap from plan-approved build entry
- **THEN** the system SHALL stop instead of opening a beta branch from a dirty mainline state

#### Scenario: syncback rejects uncommitted beta work

- **GIVEN** the beta branch contains uncommitted implementation changes
- **WHEN** builder attempts syncback for validation
- **THEN** the system SHALL stop instead of syncing back a dirty beta worktree; the validation boundary must use a committed beta branch head

### Requirement: Builder SHALL detect branch drift and prepare remediation with approval gate

The system SHALL detect when the authoritative main/base branch has advanced relative to the beta branch and prepare an explicit remediation path instead of silently rewriting beta history.

#### Scenario: main branch advanced before finalize

- **GIVEN** beta implementation work is complete and the authoritative main/base branch now contains commits not present when beta bootstrap originally occurred
- **WHEN** builder reaches finalize or another branch-consistency checkpoint
- **THEN** the system SHALL detect the drift, prepare rebase/remediation preflight, and require explicit approval before rebasing beta onto the new mainline

#### Scenario: remediation is required but beta branch is dirty

- **GIVEN** branch drift is detected but the beta worktree is not anchored to a clean committed head
- **WHEN** builder prepares remediation
- **THEN** the system SHALL stop instead of attempting rebase/remediation on dirty beta state

### Requirement: Builder SHALL own finalize progression, including post-merge spec closeout, but stop at destructive approval

The system SHALL allow builder to continue from successful validation into merge preflight and post-merge documentation/spec closeout, but SHALL not execute destructive finalize steps without explicit approval.

#### Scenario: build execution completes successfully

- **GIVEN** implementation and validation have passed in a beta-loop-enabled plan
- **WHEN** build mode reaches completion
- **THEN** the system SHALL prepare merge / cleanup preflight inside builder and pause for explicit approval before executing merge, worktree removal, or branch deletion

#### Scenario: final test branch merge succeeds

- **GIVEN** the final `test/*` branch merge into the authoritative `baseBranch` has succeeded
- **WHEN** beta finalize enters closeout on the authoritative docs repo/worktree
- **THEN** the system SHALL promote the completed dated `/plans/` package into the related semantic `/specs/` family and treat that spec family as the durable record for the completed workflow

## Acceptance Checks

- Existing non-beta build-mode behavior remains compatible after beta-aware flow is added.
- `plan_exit` can emit beta-loop-aware handoff metadata only when planner artifacts are complete and beta execution is explicitly represented.
- Ambiguous branch/runtime decisions stop with explicit clarification requirements instead of guessed defaults.
- Builder-native beta orchestration replaces routine prompt-only AI git orchestration.
- Validation and finalize flow use deterministic built-in tooling while preserving approval gates.
- Beta finalize includes post-merge consolidation of completed `/plans/` artifacts into the related semantic `/specs/` family.
- External beta/dev MCP is not required for the intended builder UX.
