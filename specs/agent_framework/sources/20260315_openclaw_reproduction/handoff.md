# Handoff: openclaw_reproduction

## Execution Contract

- `openclaw_reproduction` is the single active planning authority for OpenClaw-aligned runner evolution.
- Use benchmark conclusions and implementation slices from this package together; do not bounce between older `openclaw*` packages as if they were co-equal active plans.
- `specs/20260316_kill-switch/` is the implementation detail reference for kill-switch work; authority remains here.
- Channel concept cancelled (2026-03-17) — all channel-related specs, IDEF0/GRAFCET (A6-A8), and former Stages B/C/D are obsolete.
- Build agent must read `tasks.md` before coding; runtime todo must be materialized from `tasks.md` before execution continues.
- Build agent must not resume from discussion memory alone when this plan package is available.
- User-visible progress and decision prompts must reuse the same planner-derived todo naming.

## Required Reads

- `proposal.md` — requirement wording, revision history, effective requirements, scope
- `spec.md` — GIVEN/WHEN/THEN structured requirements for all slices
- `design.md` — architecture decisions, state model, control protocol, pending design decisions
- `implementation-spec.md` — phased execution plan with stop gates and validation
- `tasks.md` — canonical task list with completion status
- `specs/20260316_kill-switch/` — kill-switch implementation detail specs (control-protocol, rbac-hooks, snapshot-orchestration)

### Stage 5 背景（2026-03-20 架構反思）

Phase 0 至 Stage 4 建設了完整的**控制面**（kill-switch、trigger、lane queue、daemon、workspace），但核心痛點未解：agent 在有完整 plan 的情況下依然以回合制模式運行。

根因不在控制面，而在**執行面**：`end_turn` 後走 14 道閘門 + LLM Governor + enqueue + 5s supervisor = 昂貴的回合間銜接。Plan-trusting mode (Phase 5A) 已嘗試跳過 Governor，但門檻過高且無法消除 enqueue → supervisor → 新 runLoop 的延遲。

Stage 5 方案：在 plan-trusting 條件下，`end_turn` 後**直接在 while loop 內**注入 synthetic continue 並 `continue`，不離開迴圈。同時降低 plan-trusting 門檻（只要 autonomous + executionReady + hasTodos）、加入 autonomous execution prompt 抑制模型不必要的 end_turn。

## Stop Gates In Force

1. ~~**No production API without security sign-off**~~ — **CLEARED** (2026-03-16, approved by project owner)
2. **No build beyond Trigger + Queue** without explicit user approval for Phases 5-6
3. ~~**No D.1-D.3 build** without explicit approval~~ — **CLEARED** (2026-03-17, D.1-D.3 delivered)
7. ~~**No Stage B/C/D build**~~ — **CANCELLED** (2026-03-17, channel concept removed, replaced by Stage 4: Channel-to-Workspace Refactor)
8. ~~**No Stage 4 (Channel-to-Workspace Refactor) build**~~ — **CLEARED** (2026-03-17, Stage 4 delivered)
4. **No silent fallback** or implicit authority recovery in any implementation
5. **No multi-authority plan drift** — if a new sibling plan is needed, user must explicitly approve
6. **Preserve gate semantics** — trigger/queue abstraction must not break approved mission / approval / decision gates

## Build Entry Recommendation

- **All phases through Stage 4 complete** — Phases 0-6 + D.1-D.3 + Stage 4 delivered
- **Cleanup done (2026-03-17)**: aws4fetch + ioredis removed, heartbeat integration test added
- **openclaw merged to cms** (2026-03-17) — fast-forward at `b4c6013d8f`

### Next: Stage 5 — Tight Loop Continuation（實驗）

控制面已完備。核心痛點轉移到執行面：回合間銜接成本。

**實驗 branch**: `exp/tight-loop-continuation` (opencode repo)
**實作重點**: prompt.ts tight loop bypass → 砍掉 14 閘門 + Governor → inline synthetic continue → 不離開 while loop
**驗證方式**: 5-task benchmark 對照（baseline vs tight loop）

All spec slices delivered:
- **Slice 2** (Trigger Model Extraction): delivered in Phase 5B — RunTrigger union (Continuation/Api/Cron), evaluateGates(), pluggable trigger types
- **Slice 3** (Lane-aware Run Queue): delivered in Phase 6 + workspace integration — RunQueue with priority lanes, kill-switch blocks dequeue, supervisor routes through workspace command lanes

~~Former Stages B/C/D (channel E2E, channel UI, channel extensions) — cancelled~~
~~Stage 4 (Channel-to-Workspace Refactor) — delivered (2026-03-17)~~

## Resolved Design Decisions

| ID | Decision | Resolution | Rationale |
|----|----------|------------|-----------|
| DD-1 | Real-time status push mechanism | **SSE** | Codebase 100% SSE-native（streamSSE from Hono），zero WebSocket infrastructure。複用現有 Bus → SSE → event-reducer pipeline |

## Pending Design Decisions

No pending design decisions. All DD-1 through DD-19 resolved.

| ID | Decision | Resolution | Rationale |
|----|----------|------------|-----------|
| DD-2 | MFA integration approach | **Reuse existing** | Phase 4 security sign-off confirmed existing MFA system sufficient |
| DD-3 | Snapshot timing vs hard-kill window | **Fixed soft_timeout** | Phase 4 E2E tests validated fixed-window approach; dynamic extension deferred as non-critical |

## Completion / Retrospective Contract

- Review implementation against the proposal's effective requirement description.
- Generate a validation checklist derived from `tasks.md`, runtime todo outcomes, implementation results, and executed validations.
- Report requirement coverage, partial fulfillment, deferred items, and remaining gaps as concise review output.
- Do not expose raw internal chain-of-thought; expose only auditable conclusions and evidence.
