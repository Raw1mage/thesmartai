# OpenCode Project Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the `opencode` monorepo structure, detailing the various packages, their purposes, and relationships. It is intended to guide developers and AI agents in understanding the system's organization.

## Document Purpose & Maintenance Contract

This file is an **architecture state document**, not an event log.

1. **Primary purpose**
   - Record the **current architecture baseline** (what is true now).
   - Provide **high-signal file/module index summaries** for core runtime areas.

2. **What belongs here**
   - Stable architecture contracts, boundaries, invariants, and component responsibilities.
   - File-level summary/index updates when architecture-relevant code paths are added/changed.

3. **What does NOT belong here**
   - Chronological implementation diary, debug timeline, or step-by-step change history.
   - Temporary migration notes that are no longer part of current runtime truth.

4. **Where change history goes instead**
   - Use `docs/events/event_<YYYYMMDD>_<topic>.md` for decision trail, RCA, execution logs, and validation records.

5. **Update rule (mandatory)**
   - If a change affects architecture boundaries/contracts or adds/removes important runtime modules, update this document's relevant architecture section and/or file index summaries in the same task.

## Branching Strategy & Project Context

The project operates with a specific branching strategy that defines the architectural direction:

### `cms` Branch (Current Production Line)

The `cms` branch is the primary product line for this environment, featuring significant enhancements over the upstream `origin/dev`.

**Key Features of `cms`:**

1.  **Global Multi-Account Management**: A unified system for managing multiple provider accounts.
2.  **Rotation3D System**: A dynamic model switching and load balancing system (`rotation3d`), enabling high availability and rate limit management.
3.  **Admin Panel (`/admin`)**: A centralized "Three-in-One" management interface for system administration.
4.  **Provider Granularity**: The legacy monolithic `google` provider is canonically split into provider-keyed runtime entries that maximize resource utilization:
    - `gemini-cli`: Optimized for batch processing and large context.
    - `google-api`: For lightweight, high-speed requests.
    - legacy aliases are not valid canonical runtime provider keys.

### Upstream Integration

- **`origin/dev`**: The upstream source. Changes from `origin/dev` are **analyzed and refactored** before being integrated into `cms`. Direct merges are prohibited to preserve the `cms` architecture.
- **External Plugins**: Located in `/refs`, these are also subject to analysis and refactoring before integration.

### Cross-Surface Runtime Architecture (current state)

#### Web runtime boundaries

1. **Auth boundary (`WebAuth`)**
   - Browser uses cookie-session + CSRF protection.
   - CLI/TUI compatibility path can still use Basic auth where required.
   - CLI bearer-token requests are identity-bound: `Authorization: Bearer <OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN>` must include `x-opencode-user`.

2. **Instance boundary (`Instance.directory`)**
   - Request directory is canonically resolved server-side and echoed via `X-Opencode-Resolved-Directory`.
   - Relative directory overrides are resolved from authenticated user home; absolute paths are preserved (then validated for existence).
   - Directory override from request is only accepted on loopback, authenticated web mode, or explicit global browse enablement.

3. **PTY boundary (`/pty`)**
   - PTY sessions require explicit create → connect lifecycle.
   - Stale PTY ids are treated as invalid session state and must be recreated.

#### TUI/Web admin capability boundary

- **TUI `/admin`** is the canonical control plane for provider/account/model operations and rotation-aware diagnostics.
- **Web** provides an admin-lite model manager that reuses the same backend account/provider APIs, including provider visibility toggles plus account add/view/rename/delete/set-active flows inside `packages/app/src/components/dialog-select-model.tsx`.
- **KillSwitch (Global Control Plane)**: A centralized emergency system to pause or terminate all autonomous activities.
  - Managed via `KillSwitchService` and exposed through `KillSwitchRoutes`.
  - Supports MFA-guarded triggers, scoped actions (global/session), and automated snapshots.
  - Enforcement is integrated into the session prompt path and scheduler.
- **Shared external session-switch bridge** now reuses the existing `tui.session.select` event contract across both surfaces:
  - backend route `/api/v2/tui/select-session` publishes `TuiEvent.SessionSelect`
  - `system-manager.manage_session.open` targets the local loopback runtime control URL derived from `/etc/opencode/opencode.cfg` (`http://127.0.0.1:<OPENCODE_PORT>/api/v2`), not the public proxy URL
  - server auth grants a narrow localhost exception only for requests whose **real Bun socket peer** is loopback and that carry no forwarded/proxy IP headers; this bypass is not header-trust-based
  - TUI consumes `tui.session.select` via `route.navigate(...)`
  - Web consumes the same SSE event in `packages/app/src/app.tsx` via a wildcard `globalSDK.event.listen(...)` listener, then resolves session directory and navigates to `/:dir/session/:sessionID`
  - wildcard listening is required because SSE events are emitted under `directory: Instance.directory`, not a guaranteed `"global"` channel
  - contract goal: MCP/system-manager session open must produce a real visible session switch on both TUI and Web, not a URL-only pseudo-success

#### Deployment/runtime consistency

- Docker web profile (`docker-compose.production.yml` + `Dockerfile.production`) follows the same `/opt/opencode` runtime contract as native environments.
- MCP runtime services are canonicalized under `packages/mcp/*`; `scripts/*` keeps compatibility shims only.
- Beta dev helper `testbeta.sh` launches the beta repo as Linux user `betaman` and intentionally uses betaman's own home/XDG runtime state (`~betaman/.config/opencode`, etc.). This gives betaman a dedicated runtime identity while still avoiding writes into the pkcs12 cms checkout.
- Dev config sync scripts use non-owner/non-group-preserving rsync semantics for template/runtime mirroring, preventing permission failures when runtime user and repo owner differ.
- For dev safety, template/runtime skill mirroring is skipped when the effective runtime `skills` path resolves outside the current user's home (for example a shared symlink such as `~betaman/.config/opencode/skills -> /home/pkcs12/projects/skills`). This prevents beta launches from mutating shared/cms-adjacent skill trees.
- `script/runtime-init-check.ts` is a **dev-only preflight** wired into `bun run dev` variants. Its job is to ensure baseline XDG runtime dirs/files exist from `templates/manifest.json` before local development startup. Production/runtime install responsibility remains with `install.sh` + `script/install.ts`, not with this dev helper.
- Production install normalizes `OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH` to the installed frontend bundle under `/usr/local/share/opencode/frontend`, so installed systemd/web runtimes do not depend on repo-local `packages/app/dist` paths.
- `./webctl.sh web-refresh` is intentionally repo-detached for installed production runtimes: it is now restart-only, and no longer rebuilds or redeploys frontend/binary assets from the source checkout. Any production asset rollout must go through an explicit install/deploy step.
- Controlled Web restart now has an explicit runtime control-path contract:
  - Web settings may trigger `POST /api/v2/global/web/restart`
  - backend restart control resolves the script path from runtime configuration (`OPENCODE_WEBCTL_PATH`, default `/etc/opencode/webctl.sh`)
  - `webctl.sh restart` intentionally preserves the currently active runtime mode; dev returns to dev semantics, production returns to production semantics
  - frontend then waits for `/api/v2/global/health` to recover before reloading
  - this is **action-triggered restart recovery**, not a generic always-on auto-refresh channel
- `./webctl.sh dev-start` now declares internal MCP source mode explicitly (`OPENCODE_INTERNAL_MCP_MODE=source` + `OPENCODE_REPO_ROOT`). In that mode, project-owned MCP entries such as `system-manager` and `refacting-merger` are deterministically normalized to `bun <repo>/packages/mcp/...` commands instead of `/usr/local/lib/opencode/mcp/*` system binaries; enable/disable still remains config-driven via each MCP entry's `enabled` flag.

#### Web multi-user runtime architecture

1. **Service identity model**
   - `opencode-web.service` runs as a no-home service identity (`HOME=/nonexistent`).
   - Service binaries/wrappers are expected under `/usr/local/*`.

2. **Gateway + per-user daemon topology**
   - Gateway process serves web/auth/API entrypoints.
   - User-scoped runtime operations are routed to per-user daemon instances (`opencode-user-daemon@.service`) under authenticated Linux user context.

3. **Routed API policy**
   - Per-user-daemon routed APIs use strict no-fallback behavior: daemon path failure returns structured `503`.
   - This prevents mixed-source reads/writes across service-scope and user-scope runtime paths.

4. **Daemon-routed API domains**
   - Config APIs: read/update.
   - Account APIs: list + mutation routes.
   - Session APIs: list/read/status/top + mutation routes.

- Session records now also carry persisted workflow metadata (`workflow.autonomous`, `workflow.state`, stop reason, timestamps) as the foundation for autonomous-session continuation.
- Session records now also carry a persisted runner mission contract (`session.mission`) that acts as the authority boundary for autonomous execution. Current mission contract shape is OpenSpec-derived: autonomous continuation is only allowed when the session carries an approved `openspec_compiled_plan` / `implementation_spec` mission marked `executionReady=true`.
- `plan` / `build` semantics are now being reinterpreted around **discussion emphasis vs execution emphasis**, not naive readonly vs writable separation:
  - `plan` is the planner-first discussion agent responsible for spec refinement, decision capture, and plan-derived todo maintenance
  - `build` is the execution-first workflow mode under which coding/review/testing/docs/explore agents advance the current plan
  - this means entering `plan` does not conceptually imply “absolutely no edits ever”, and being in `build` does not imply “planning is forbidden”; instead, the difference is the default responsibility and gate posture
- In-process continuation is now wired inside the prompt loop: after an assistant round completes, the runtime can synthesize the next user step from outstanding todos when autonomous mode is enabled and no blocker/approval stop condition is active.
- `plan_exit` is now the canonical bridge from planning to runner execution authority: after companion artifacts pass completeness gates and the user approves the handoff, runtime both materializes structured todos and persists the approved mission contract onto the session. This means `/specs` plans are no longer just planner-side artifacts; they are the first supported runtime mission source for autonomous runner work.
- Todo authority is now **mode-aware** with two distinct semantics:
  - **Plan mode (working ledger)**: todowrite() may be used freely for exploration, debugging, small fixes, and temporary tracking. Structure changes are auto-promoted to `working_ledger` mode. No planner artifacts are required before writing todos.
  - **Build mode (execution ledger)**: todo is a runtime projection of planner artifacts, not a freeform authoring surface. The durable source of truth is the active planner package under `specs/<date>_<plan-title>/`. `tasks.md`/handoff drive runtime todo materialization. Structure changes require explicit `plan_materialization` or `replan_adoption` mode. `status_update` mode is limited to status transitions only.
  - sidebar/work monitor is the observability surface for runtime todo state in both modes
  - in build mode, visible runtime todo should remain stable unless planner artifacts/replan/status actually changed; it must not drift just because the assistant internally reorganized its own short-term working notes
  - when the system asks the user for a decision, it should reference the same planner-derived runtime todo names shown in sidebar/work monitor
  - `plan_exit` is the canonical transition point: it materializes planner-derived execution todos and switches todo authority from working ledger to execution ledger
  - `plan_enter` switches todo authority back to working ledger mode
- Planner package layout is now:
  - root: `specs/<date>_<plan-title>/`
  - title segment uses a slugified session title when available; default generated session titles fall back to session slug
  - companion artifacts remain `implementation-spec.md`, `proposal.md`, `spec.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, and `handoff.md`
- Planner re-entry now prefers continuity over recomputing a fresh root:
  - if `session.mission.artifactPaths.root` exists and still contains an implementation spec, planner reuses that package
  - otherwise planner checks current title-derived root and immutable slug-derived root for an existing package before creating a new one
  - this prevents the same workstream from fragmenting into multiple planner roots just because session title changed after the first real user prompt
- `tasks.md` checklist parsing and runtime todo lineage now have an explicit shared contract:
  - shared parser lives in `packages/opencode/src/session/tasks-checklist.ts`
  - planner materialization uses **unchecked** checklist items as the runtime todo seed
  - mission consumption may read both unchecked and checked items for bounded execution trace purposes
  - current handoff metadata now exposes `todoMaterializationPolicy` with the active defaults (`maxSeedItems=8`, first todo `in_progress/high`, remaining todos `pending/medium`, `linear_chain` dependency strategy)
- Because planner discussions are iterative, overlapping replans no longer fully overwrite todo truth. `Todo.update()` now preserves overlapping `completed`, `cancelled`, and `in_progress` items so a fresh plan skeleton cannot silently erase visible progress state.
- Autonomous turns now also emit short transcript-visible progress narration messages (`continue` / `pause` / `complete`) so the shared session surface can explain what the runtime is doing without requiring the user to inspect only sidebar state.
- Incoming real user prompts may now safely preempt a busy autonomous synthetic run. Runtime cleanup is keyed by per-run identity so an old aborted loop cannot accidentally clear the replacement loop.
- A durable continuation queue foundation now exists under session storage, and the server runtime now starts an in-process autonomous supervisor that scans pending continuation records and re-enters session loops for idle autonomous sessions.
- Autonomous synthetic continuation turns now also carry mission metadata (`source / contract / planPath / artifactPaths`) on the synthetic user text part, so downstream execution can be traced back to the approved OpenSpec mission that authorized the run.
- Delegated execution baseline is now implemented on top of that continuation path: synthetic continuation metadata includes a bounded delegation contract (role/source/todo trace), and runtime only emits bounded roles `coding` / `testing` / `docs` / `review` / `generic`.
- When mission artifacts cannot be consumed, autonomous continuation now fail-fast stops with `stopReason=mission_not_consumable` and records `workflow.mission_not_consumable` anomaly evidence (no silent fallback to todo-only continuation).
- `mission_not_approved` is now a first-class stop reason in the autonomous continuation pipeline. When a session lacks an approved mission contract, runtime moves workflow state to `waiting_user` with `stopReason=mission_not_approved` instead of silently continuing from todos alone.
- Current autorunner compatibility baseline:
  - autorunner is already structurally coupled to approved mission artifacts (`implementation-spec.md`, `tasks.md`, `handoff.md`) and current todo/workflow state
  - this is sufficient for plan-derived continuation, queue resume, and gate-aware stopping
  - autorunner now has a phase-1 dedicated runner-level contract asset at `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt/runner.txt`, and `workflow-runner.ts` prepends that contract to autonomous build-mode continuation instructions
  - however, this is still not full session-governor formalization: stop-gate ownership remains deterministic in runtime code, and deeper planner-boundary/runtime-ownership binding is still pending
  - the next architectural direction is documented in `docs/specs/autorunner_daemon_architecture.md`: evolving session execution from conversation-turn-centric to daemon-owned long-lived jobs with event-sourced state, durable queue/lease/heartbeat model, prompt loop demotion to execution adapter, and independent worker supervisor registry
- Planning agent reactivation is now formalized in `docs/specs/planning_agent_runtime_reactivation.md`: the goal is to make plan mode a first-class front door for non-trivial autonomous work by strengthening trigger classification, aligning plan-mode prompts with current `agent-workflow` / `todowrite` / question contracts, and ensuring plan output is directly consumable as autorunner substrate (not just a document artifact)
- Planner/runner handback boundaries now include:
  - `spec_dirty`: approved planner artifacts changed after approval; autonomous execution must stop and return to planner
  - `replan_required`: host-adopted replan/governor signal requires planner re-entry instead of silent todo reshaping continuation
- A new session-scoped runtime event journal baseline exists in `packages/opencode/src/system/runtime-event-service.ts`. It persists structured runtime events with fixed fields (`ts / level / domain / eventType / sessionID / todoID? / anomalyFlags[] / payload`) and currently serves as the minimal evidence substrate for runner/workflow anomalies.
- First anomaly integration is now active for stale delegated-subagent waits: when workflow evaluation stops at `wait_subagent` but no active subtask remains and todo state still says `waitingOn=subagent`, runtime records `workflow.unreconciled_wait_subagent` into that event journal instead of leaving the inconsistency purely implicit in scattered state surfaces.
- Web prompt footer now exposes a direct autonomous entrypoint in `packages/app/src/components/prompt-input.tsx`: the first footer provider label (for example `OpenAI`) doubles as the autonomous toggle. When enabled, that provider label switches to a highlighted active state; clicking it calls `POST /api/v2/session/:sessionID/autonomous`, which persists `workflow.autonomous.enabled` and, when enabling an idle session, immediately enqueues a synthetic autonomous continue turn so the in-process supervisor can resume work without waiting for a manual follow-up prompt. In per-user daemon routed mode, this same endpoint follows the existing `routeSessionMutationEnabled` path and is forwarded via `UserDaemonManager.callSessionAutonomous(...)` so autonomous toggles and continuation enqueue remain user-scoped.
- Experimental Smart Runner support now has two guarded stages:
  - `experimental.smart_runner.enabled=true`: after the deterministic runner chooses a low-risk continue path, the prompt loop may invoke `packages/opencode/src/session/smart-runner-governor.ts` with a compact context pack and persist the advisory result under `workflow.supervisor.lastGovernorTrace*`; the supervisor also keeps a bounded recent `governorTraceHistory` window for session-side inspection.
  - `experimental.smart_runner.assist=true`: the same Smart Runner trace may adjust only low-risk continuation behavior (`continue_current`, `start_next_todo`, `docs_sync_first`, `debug_preflight_first`). For docs/debug modes, the runtime now injects an explicit preflight continuation contract before the planned step; deterministic guardrails still remain the sole authority for stop gates, approval gates, completion, and pause states.
- Smart Runner traces now also carry assist outcome metadata (`enabled / applied / mode / finalTextChanged / narrationUsed`) so session-side inspection can distinguish between advisory noise and actually adopted bounded-assist decisions.
- Smart Runner traces may also carry bounded `suggestion` metadata for non-authoritative route shaping. The currently unlocked suggestion types are `replan` and `ask_user`; both are surfaced in session inspection/history only and do not mutate todos or override deterministic control flow.
- For `replan` suggestions, Smart Runner may now also attach a bounded replan request structure (`targetTodoID / requestedAction / proposedNextStep / note`) so humans can inspect the proposed reshaping without letting runtime mutate todos.
- For `replan` suggestions, Smart Runner may also attach a bounded adoption proposal (`proposalID / targetTodoID / proposedAction / proposedNextStep / rationale / adoptionNote`) so the host/runtime can later choose to adopt the proposal into a real todo replan without granting Smart Runner direct mutation authority.
- For `replan` suggestions, those adoption proposals now also carry bounded policy metadata (`trustLevel / adoptionMode / requiresUserConfirm / requiresHostReview`). The current policy is `host_adoptable` at `medium` trust with required host review.
- A deterministic host-adoption path is now unlocked for that `replan` policy: when there is no active in-progress todo, the target todo is dependency-ready, and the proposal does not bypass approval/waiting gates, runtime may promote the proposed target todo to `in_progress` before the next autonomous continue turn. Smart Runner still does not mutate todos directly; runtime records the adoption result back onto the trace as `hostAdopted=true|false` plus `hostAdoptionReason` so session-side inspection can distinguish adopted proposals from ineligible/rejected ones.
- For `ask_user` suggestions, Smart Runner may now also attach a bounded draft question string so humans can inspect the proposed wording before any actual question flow is triggered.
- For `ask_user` suggestions, Smart Runner may also attach a bounded handoff structure (`question / whyNow / blockingDecision / impactIfUnanswered`) so the human/session host can see exactly what decision is being escalated and why.
- For `ask_user` suggestions, Smart Runner may also attach a bounded adoption proposal (`proposalID / proposedQuestion / targetTodoID / rationale / adoptionNote`) so the host/runtime can later choose to adopt the proposal into a real question flow without granting Smart Runner direct authority.
- For `ask_user` suggestions, those adoption proposals now also carry bounded policy metadata (`trustLevel / adoptionMode / requiresUserConfirm / requiresHostReview`). The current policy is `user_confirm_required` at `medium` trust with required host review.
- A deterministic host-adoption path is now also unlocked for that `ask_user` policy: when the proposal includes a usable question draft, host review is still required, and the session does not already have a pending question, runtime may adopt the proposal by calling `Question.ask(...)`. The Smart Runner proposal itself still does not question the user directly.
- When that host-adopted question is answered, runtime resumes the loop by persisting a synthetic user turn that summarizes the answer and continues under the normal prompt loop. When the question is rejected/dismissed, runtime records the rejection outcome back onto the trace and moves workflow state to `waiting_user` with stop reason `product_decision_needed`.
- Ask-user adoption results are persisted back onto the trace as `hostAdopted=true|false` plus `hostAdoptionReason` (for example `adopted`, `missing_question`, `question_already_pending`, `question_rejected`) so session-side inspection/history can distinguish adopted, ineligible, and rejected host outcomes.
- For `request_approval` suggestions, Smart Runner may attach bounded approval-request metadata (`proposalID / targetTodoID / rationale / approvalScope / adoptionNote / policy`). The current policy is `host_adoptable` at `medium` trust with required host review.
- A deterministic host-adoption path is unlocked for `request_approval`: when the proposal remains `host_adoptable`, does not require explicit user-confirm metadata, and still requires host review, runtime may adopt it by persisting the trace and moving workflow state to `waiting_user` with stop reason `approval_needed`.
- For `pause_for_risk` suggestions, Smart Runner may attach bounded risk-pause metadata (`proposalID / targetTodoID / rationale / riskSummary / pauseScope / adoptionNote / policy`). This is intentionally distinct from formal approval gates: it represents a deliberate human review pause for risky work, not a hard approval contract.
- A deterministic host-adoption path is also unlocked for `pause_for_risk`: under the same `host_adoptable` + host-review-required policy checks, runtime may adopt it by persisting the trace and moving workflow state to `waiting_user` with stop reason `risk_review_needed`.
- For host-adopted Smart Runner stop paths that do not themselves open a visible question flow (`request_approval`, `pause_for_risk`), runtime now emits a transcript-visible pause narration using the governor-proposed operator text, prefixed with `[AI]`, before ending the loop. This keeps adopted governance pauses observable in the shared transcript rather than only in workflow/session debug state.
- Smart Runner `complete` decisions are now interpreted conservatively: the governor may propose a bounded todo-completion request, but host adoption only succeeds if (1) the targeted todo is the current actionable work, (2) it is safe to mark complete, and (3) deterministic re-evaluation immediately confirms the workflow is terminal (`todo_complete`). If any further actionable todo remains, host refuses adoption and records a non-terminal completion reason instead of prematurely closing the workflow.
- Session-side Smart Runner observability now treats `request_approval`, `pause_for_risk`, and `complete` as first-class suggestion/adoption paths alongside `ask_user` and `replan`: the side panel summary counts them explicitly, and trace history/debug output surfaces their proposal IDs, policy mode, and host adoption outcomes.
- For `request_approval` and `pause_for_risk`, host now also preserves non-adopted policy outcomes back into the continuing trace path (for example `policy_not_host_adoptable`), instead of only recording adopted pauses. This keeps later assist/summary history symmetric with `ask_user`, `replan`, and `complete` when a proposal is declined.
- Smart Runner plain `pause` decisions are now surfaced as advisory-only suggestions too. Unlike `request_approval`, `pause_for_risk`, or `complete`, this path intentionally does not create a host-adoptable contract; it exists so session traces can still show that the governor recommended stopping autonomous continuation without escalating to a stronger intervention type.
- Session-side Smart Runner observability now also treats advisory `pause` as a first-class suggestion surface: debug/history can show the pause scope and advisory-only policy, while summary counts it separately from host-adopted pause-like interventions such as `pause_for_risk`.
- Advisory `pause` now also has a bounded assist path: it still does not create a host-adopted stop contract, but when assist mode is enabled, runtime rewrites the next continue instruction into a pause-check/preflight prompt so autonomous execution must first restate uncertainty, missing evidence, or the exact condition that now makes continuation safe.
- Session-side Smart Runner summary now also counts that advisory `pause` assist mode explicitly, so the side panel can distinguish plain pause observations from pause advice that actually rewrote the next continue step.
- Smart Runner adoption policy evaluation is now normalized through a shared helper layer: `ask_user` still keeps extra gates like question-text presence and pending-question checks, but the underlying policy-mode / user-confirm / host-review checks are evaluated through one common contract used by both user-confirm and host-adoptable paths.
- Session-side Smart Runner summary now also aggregates non-adopted reasons across recent trace history (for example `policy_not_host_adoptable`, `not_terminal_after_completion`) so operators can see refusal patterns without manually scanning each individual history row.
- Session-side Smart Runner history/debug now also expands the payload details of `replan` and `complete`: replan surfaces its target todo/action, and complete surfaces its completion scope, so operators can see what was being rearranged or marked done without opening the raw trace JSON.
- As a pre-observability step toward the longer-term meeting model, session summary now exposes a lightweight Smart Runner conversation layer derived from `[AI]` autonomous narration parts: counts of AI narrations/pause/completion signals plus the latest AI-authored transcript text. This does not make Smart Runner a co-equal speaker yet, but it makes its conversational interventions inspectable as a distinct layer next to the main assistant flow.
- That conversation layer now also feeds the top-level session process summary (`AI layer: ...`, `AI latest: ...`), so operators can notice Smart Runner conversational activity even before expanding the detailed history card.
- The conversation layer now also tracks AI narration kind distribution (`continue`, `pause`, `complete`, etc.), giving a lightweight meeting-style view of how Smart Runner has been intervening conversationally over the recent transcript.
- The conversation layer now also derives a semantic `latestRole` classification (`interruption`, `completion`, `continuation`, `other`) from the latest `[AI]` narration kind, so summaries and the side panel can describe the most recent Smart Runner intervention in meeting-style terms rather than only raw kind labels.
- The conversation layer now also aggregates role distribution counts from recent `[AI]` narrations, so operators can inspect meeting-style intervention mix (`interruption`, `completion`, `continuation`, `other`) alongside raw narration-kind counts.
- The conversation layer now also keeps a short recent-role trend sequence derived from the latest `[AI]` narrations, allowing summaries and the side panel to show the recent meeting-style intervention flow (for example interruption → completion → continuation).
- The conversation layer now also derives a compact operator digest from the latest role plus recent-role trend, giving session summaries and the side panel a short human-scannable Smart Runner status line without requiring operators to parse every individual field.
- The recent-role trend and operator digest are now explicitly bounded to the latest 5 Smart Runner narration roles, establishing a stable observability window for UI summaries and tests rather than leaving that window size as an implicit implementation detail.
- The operator digest now uses a shorter role-sequence token format (`int/cmp/cont/other`) and is treated as the primary trend line in process summary output, reducing duplicated long-form trend text while preserving side-panel detail fields.
- Session-side inspection now also derives a Smart Runner summary layer from recent trace history: applied/noop counts, assist-mode counts, suggestion counts, and a short recent-decision trend strip for faster human evaluation.
- When Smart Runner actually rewrites autonomous loop text (synthetic continue instructions or narration overrides), runtime now prefixes that inserted text with `[AI]` so it is visually distinguishable from ordinary assistant output.
- Model preference APIs: read/update.

5. **Web realtime behavior**
   - Primary path: SSE global events (`/global/event`) drive incremental UI updates.
   - Reliability fallback: while `session.status !== idle`, web periodically forces message snapshot hydration (`session.sync(..., { force: true })`) so assistant replies remain visible without page refresh if SSE propagation is delayed/dropped.
   - Prompt footer quota metadata is **not** driven by raw SSE deltas alone. For OpenAI usage, web uses a conditional refresh gate in `packages/app/src/components/prompt-input.tsx`: it refetches quota only when a new assistant turn completes **and** the previous quota refresh is older than 60 seconds **and** the effective provider key is `openai`.
   - This keeps footer usage reasonably fresh after real AI interaction while avoiding constant polling for idle pages or non-OpenAI providers.

6. **Runtime ownership target**
   - Runtime memory/history/config/state are owned by authenticated user home (`~/.config`, `~/.local/share`, `~/.local/state`).
   - Historical transition details and RCA remain in `docs/events/`.

7. **Review data-path observability contract (web)**
   - `GET /file/status` returns lightweight diagnostics headers:
     - `X-Opencode-Review-Directory`
     - `X-Opencode-Review-Count`
   - Deep diagnostics route `GET /experimental/review-checkpoint` is available only when `OPENCODE_DEBUG_REVIEW_CHECKPOINT=1`.

8. **Web scroll incident observability contract**
   - Frontend scroll RCA auto-capture now has a dedicated retained server path separate from generic `/log` batching.
   - Browser auto-capture posts to `POST /experimental/scroll-capture`.
   - Latest retained evidence is readable from `GET /experimental/scroll-capture/latest`.
   - Server persists this retained slot at `${Global.Path.log}/scroll-capture-latest.json` with `latest` plus bounded `recent` history.
   - Goal: when an operator reports「發生了」, debugging can inspect a fixed capture slot instead of scanning generic debug.log output.

9. **Session turn rendering contract (web session UI)**
   - Session turn steps/tool/reasoning output no longer depend on a collapsible trigger to be visible.
   - The working trace is rendered inline in normal document flow inside `packages/ui/src/components/session-turn.tsx`.
   - The transient working/status row (`thinking` / retry / duration) is rendered as a separate bottom status line _after_ the inline steps block, so growing tool/reasoning output stays above it.
   - Sticky header participation is disabled for this inline-steps path; the session scroller remains the intended outer scroll owner.
   - Working tool cards (`part.state.status !== "completed"`) bypass the `BasicTool` collapsible route and render via a flat inline container.
   - `packages/ui/src/components/basic-tool.css` must not use `content-visibility: auto` on tool triggers, because deferred layout/paint on long streaming mobile sessions can destabilize scroll-follow behavior.
   - Mobile scroll repair: while a session is actively working on mobile (`!isDesktop()`), prompt dock resize no longer continuously redefines layout padding or triggers prompt-dock-driven auto-follow. The page freezes a `mobilePromptHeightLock` until the session returns to idle, reducing iOS/mobile viewport chrome induced oscillation.

#### Capability registry contract

- Capability discovery source-of-truth is `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt/enablement.json` with template mirror at `templates/prompts/enablement.json`.
- Prompt/runtime routing should use this registry for tools/skills/MCP inventory and on-demand MCP lifecycle policy.

### Provider Identity & TUI Admin Runtime Architecture (cms)

Canonical naming note:

- `providerKey` / `providers` are the preferred canonical contract terms.
- Legacy `family` / `families` remain compatibility terms only and should not be extended into new APIs, docs, or helper surfaces unless explicitly required for backward compatibility.

This section defines the **authoritative** provider/account/model architecture for cms TUI `/admin` and backend runtime.
Historical change logs belong in `docs/events/`; this document keeps the current architecture only.

#### A) cms Provider Graph (authoritative coordinates)

The runtime must treat identities as explicit coordinates, with a strict hierarchy:

1. **Provider** (canonical runtime/vendor key)
   - This is the account-bearing boundary.
   - Provider decides auth, account binding, quota/cooldown tracking, routing, and execution ownership.
   - Examples: `openai`, `github-copilot`, `gemini-cli`, `google-api`.
2. **Account** (provider-scoped)
   - Active + candidate accounts under a provider in `accounts.json`.
   - Account selection must never be inferred from model-family labels.
3. **Model / Model family**
   - Model family is only the catalog/grouping layer for model lists and capabilities.
   - A provider may expose one or many model families.
   - Example: provider `openai` exposes OpenAI families; provider `github-copilot` may expose OpenAI / Claude / Gemini families through one provider account boundary.

Architectural rule: **provider and model family are not synonyms**.
The system must prioritize provider as the operational identity boundary, while model family remains a model-catalog concept.
No runtime decision should depend on guessing provider/account ownership from an arbitrary model-family-like string.

Provider-first migration status:

- high-risk runtime/account selection paths now prefer provider-key helpers over family-named helpers
- account/selection UI paths now group for display but bind accounts/routing via canonical provider keys
- response contracts are in compatibility mode: account APIs may still expose legacy `families` fields/paths, but newer payloads also expose provider-oriented fields such as `providerKey` / `providers`
- storage file format remains backward compatible (`accounts.json` still stores `families`), but internal helpers now increasingly treat that map as provider-keyed storage

#### A.1) Session execution identity contract

- Session execution identity is now a persisted 3D coordinate: `{ providerId, modelID, accountId? }`.
- Session-level SSOT is now additionally persisted on the session record itself as `session.execution = { providerId, modelID, accountId?, revision, updatedAt }`.
- Persistence surfaces that can now carry `accountId`:
  - `MessageV2.User.model`
  - `MessageV2.SubtaskPart.model`
  - `MessageV2.Assistant`
- Session-level execution pinning rules:
  - real user-message persistence pins `session.execution`
  - manual Web/TUI session model/account switches now also PATCH `session.execution` immediately through `session.update`, instead of waiting for the next real user turn
  - `lastModel()` now prefers `session.execution` before scanning latest user message history
  - autonomous/synthetic user turns (continuations, Smart Runner ask-user resume) must prefer `session.execution` over stale last-user snapshots
  - processor write-back paths (`assistant-persist`, fallback-applied assistant metadata) also sync the resolved runtime identity back into `session.execution`
- `revision` is the persisted session execution-identity epoch for detecting real selection changes over time; `updatedAt` records the latest authoritative write-back.
- Runtime propagation path is:
  - prompt / shell / command input
  - `user-message-context`
  - session processor preflight
  - LLM/provider transform options
  - assistant message update after actual execution / fallback
- Operational goal: session execution identity should no longer depend solely on whichever latest user/assistant message happened to survive hydration; the session record itself is now the canonical pin.
- Rule: runtime must prefer the session-carried `accountId` when present. Provider-level active account is only a fallback for legacy/default execution paths that did not pin a session account.
- Result: two sessions using the same provider may now execute with different accounts without mutating each other's execution identity, even if they happen to use models from the same model family.

#### A.2) Session runner mission contract

- Session-local autonomous execution now has a separate authority layer from plain execution identity: `session.execution` answers **which provider/model/account is executing**, while `session.mission` answers **what approved plan authorizes autonomous continuation**.
- Current persisted mission contract is stored on the session as:
  - `source` (currently `openspec_compiled_plan`)
  - `contract` (currently `implementation_spec`)
  - `approvedAt`
  - `planPath`
  - `executionReady`
  - `artifactPaths` (`root`, `implementationSpec`, `proposal`, `spec`, `design`, `tasks`, `handoff`)
- Architectural rule: autonomous runner must not continue solely because todo state exists. It may continue only when autonomous mode is enabled **and** the session carries an approved mission contract.
- Current first supported mission source is repo-local `/specs` OpenSpec change artifacts. This is the initial product path for session-scoped runners: consume an approved development plan, then drive delegated execution under that plan boundary.
- Synthetic continuation contract now includes both mission and delegated execution trace:
  - mission metadata: `source / contract / planPath / artifactPaths`
  - delegation metadata: bounded role derivation trace (`role` + derivation source/todo evidence)
- Delegated execution is intentionally bounded at this stage: `coding` / `testing` / `docs` / `review` / `generic`; ambiguous cases must stay `generic` instead of escalating to unsupported orchestration behavior.

#### B) TUI `/admin` provider operation pipeline (cms)

| Stage                             | UI Component / Route                                                          | Runtime Side Effect                                                                                      |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provider inventory bootstrap      | `tui/context/sync.tsx` (`provider.list`, `provider.auth`, `config.providers`) | Hydrates provider/auth/config state for admin menus                                                      |
| Add provider entry                | `dialog-admin.tsx` → `DialogProviderManualAdd`                                | Writes `config.provider[...]`, triggers sync bootstrap                                                   |
| Add API key (legacy route naming) | `DialogApiKeyAdd`                                                             | `Account.add(family, accountId, apiKey)` using legacy compatibility naming over canonical provider scope |
| Add Google API account            | `DialogGoogleApiAdd`                                                          | Adds `google-api` account with explicit canonical provider key                                           |
| OAuth account connect             | `DialogProvider` → `/provider/:id/oauth/*`                                    | Stores auth via `Auth.set(...)` / account module                                                         |
| Active account switch             | `/account/:family/active` (legacy route name; operationally provider-scoped)  | Rotation and model availability read new active account                                                  |

#### B.0) Control-plane vs session-local selection boundary

- **Global active account** remains a control-plane/admin concept. It is still changed through explicit account-management actions such as `/account/:provider/active` and is used as the default account when no session-local override exists.
- **Session model selection** in TUI/Web is a separate execution-state layer. Selecting a provider/model/account for the current session must update local session state first and must not require `setActive()` merely to choose the session's execution identity.
- Manual session model/account selection now has a two-write contract:
  1. update local session selection immediately for UI responsiveness
  2. PATCH `session.execution` immediately on the server so background/autonomous/runtime paths see the same pinned identity before the next prompt is submitted
- TUI `/admin` activity/model selection and Web model selection therefore operate on session-local `{ providerId, modelID, accountId? }` state, while explicit account-management screens continue to own true global active-account changes.
- Rotation/fallback may still change the effective execution account, but that change is recorded back into session/assistant metadata instead of silently rewriting the global active account.
- Manual runtime interruption now has a workflow contract too: `SessionPrompt.cancel()` aborts the in-flight runtime, clears pending autonomous continuation queue state for that session, and moves workflow state to `waiting_user` with stop reason `manual_interrupt`.
- **Same-provider rotate cooldown contract:** when rate-limit fallback performs a same-provider rotate (provider unchanged, account/model changed), runtime arms a provider-level cooldown window (default 5 minutes).
- While that cooldown is active, rotation candidate selection blocks further same-provider rotate candidates for the same provider and forces cross-provider rescue (or no-rotation if none are available).
- The cooldown is cross-process and persisted in unified rotation state as `sameProviderRotationCooldowns`.
- Rotation observability now exposes explicit checkpoints for this guard: `Same-provider rotate guard armed`, `Same-provider rotate quota consumed; forcing cross-provider fallback`, and `No cross-provider fallback available; rotation stopped`.
- Terminology rule for future work: account-binding logic, routing, cooldowns, and execution identity should be reasoned about in **provider** terms first, not in model-family terms.

#### B.0.a) Planner / build handoff contract (authoritative)

- Planner/build phase control is a **runtime state + formal artifact** contract, not a prompt-text contract.
- `plan_enter` and `plan_exit` are the authoritative phase-transition tools.
- Planner intent and executor instructions must be transmitted only through:
  1. planner artifacts (`implementation-spec.md`, `proposal.md`, `spec.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `handoff.md`)
  2. `plan_exit` handoff metadata
- Runtime must not rely on `<system-reminder>...</system-reminder>` text to tell build mode what to do.
- `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt/plan.txt` is the single prompt SSOT for plan-mode behavioral guidance, but it is not the source of truth for phase state or handoff authority.
- Plan-mode enforcement is now runtime-based:
  - allowed endings: `question` tool call, `plan_exit` tool call, or non-question progress summary
  - plain-text bounded decision questions in plan mode are enforcement violations and must fail fast instead of being repaired through synthetic retry prompt text
- Design rule: if planner wants build to know something, that information belongs in formal artifacts / handoff metadata, not in synthetic reminder text.

#### B.0.b) Synthetic reminder boundary

- Synthetic text wrappers may still exist for generic runtime packaging of queued user messages, but these wrappers are **not** authoritative control-plane signals.
- Operators and future runtime changes must distinguish:
  - **control state** → workflow/session/runtime metadata and tool transitions
  - **display or packaging text** → synthetic text parts that help model formatting or conversation continuity
- Any future attempt to encode planner/build control, approval gates, or execution permissions in synthetic reminder text should be treated as an architectural regression.

#### B.1) Prompt footer quota/runtime metadata pipeline (TUI + Web)

This subsection documents how prompt footer usage/account metadata stays fresh without high CPU polling.

1. **TUI prompt footer orchestration**
   - Entry point: `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/component/prompt/index.tsx`
   - TUI computes footer metadata from current provider/model/account state and provider-specific quota hints.
   - OpenAI quota is loaded through a Solid `createResource(quotaRefresh, ...)` path (`codexQuota`).
   - Refresh policy is event-driven, not interval-driven:
     - **provider relevance gate**: quota path is only armed when the current effective provider key is `openai`
     - **initial on-demand hydrate**: entering an OpenAI-backed footer can trigger one refresh if the last refresh is older than 60 seconds
     - **turn completion signal**: when `lastCompletedAssistant` changes, TUI refreshes quota only if the previous refresh is older than 60 seconds
   - Footer account label and footer OpenAI quota both resolve from the same effective account snapshot.

- Effective account precedence is:
  1.  current session-local `accountId`
  2.  fail-soft / no quota label when account identity is absent
- Footer/quota paths must no longer silently switch to another active account just to fill UI gaps.
  - The low-frequency footer timer (default 15s via `OPENCODE_TUI_FOOTER_REFRESH_MS`) is retained for lightweight elapsed/account display updates only; it does **not** poll OpenAI quota in the background.
  - Result: footer usage stays fresh during real OpenAI usage while avoiding idle quota polling.

    1.1 **TUI `/admin` quota display behavior**

- Entry point: `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/component/dialog-admin.tsx`
- Opening `/admin` is treated as a legitimate quota display request.
- Admin OpenAI usage rows resolve through `getQuotaHintsForAccounts(...)` → `getOpenAIQuotaForDisplay(...)`, so they share the same display cache policy as the prompt footer.
- Shared rule: OpenAI display cache TTL is 60 seconds. Within that window, footer/admin reuse cached values; after that window, the next visible display request returns cached data and triggers refresh via stale-while-revalidate.

2. **Web prompt footer orchestration**
   - Entry point: `packages/app/src/components/prompt-input.tsx`
   - Web prompt footer also derives metadata from current provider/account state, but OpenAI quota refresh is stricter than TUI for browser efficiency.
   - The footer's model/account identity is backed by session-local Web selection state from `packages/app/src/context/local.tsx`.
   - `packages/app/src/pages/session.tsx` must therefore synchronize that session-local selection from both:
     1. the latest visible user message model (initial/pinned session identity)
     2. the latest completed non-narration assistant message model/account (post-`rotation3d` effective execution identity)
   - Guard rule: Web must not treat autonomous narration-only assistant messages as execution-identity updates, and it must not overwrite a session-local selection that the operator has already manually changed away from the last user-pinned model.

- Effective account precedence mirrors TUI: prefer session-local selected `accountId`, then fall back to the provider active account.
- Web footer is still session/local-state-driven, but account/quota surfaces should prefer explicit session account identity and fail soft rather than silently consulting a different account.
- The web quota resource key is gated by `quotaRefresh` and only becomes active for `openai`.
- Observability contract for turn-level execution identity now includes explicit `audit.identity` checkpoints in debug log:
  - `requestPhase=preflight`: processor selected the current turn's provider/model/account before API call
  - `requestPhase=llm-start`: `LLM.stream()` started with the resolved execution identity
  - `requestPhase=fallback-switch`: rate-limit / temporary / permanent failure switched to another provider-account-model vector
  - `requestPhase=assistant-persist`: resolved execution identity was written back into assistant metadata
- Required audit fields:
  - `sessionID`
  - `userMessageID`
  - `assistantMessageID?`
  - `providerId`
  - `modelID`
  - `accountId`
  - `source` (`session-pinned`, `user-message`, `active-account-fallback`, `rate-limit-fallback`, `temporary-error-fallback`, `permanent-error-fallback`, `assistant-persist`)
- Purpose: allow operators to grep one assistant turn end-to-end and answer "which account actually paid for this request, and why was it chosen?" without reconstructing the whole fallback chain from generic logs.
- Under the newer strict session policy, provider/account fallback is now blocked once session execution identity is pinned:
  - runtime may still persist a model change that stays on the same provider/account
  - runtime must not silently jump to a different provider/account inside the same session
  - when rotation proposes a different provider/account, `LLM.handleRateLimitFallback()` now emits `Session identity blocked provider/account fallback` and returns no fallback switch
- Request-layer hardening rules:
  - if session execution identity includes `accountId`, `LLM.stream()` must resolve the outbound `executionModel` to that **account provider** before calling `Provider.getLanguage(...)`
  - base providers (for example `openai`) may inherit custom fetch only from the **active account**, never from insertion-order first account
  - insertion order is not a valid account-routing policy in multi-account systems
    - Refresh policy is event-driven, not interval-driven:
      - wait for a **new completed assistant turn**
      - require **more than 60 seconds** since the previous quota refresh
    - require effective provider key = `openai`
- Non-OpenAI providers do not participate in this refresh path.

3. **Shared OpenAI quota source-of-truth**
   - Canonical implementation: `packages/opencode/src/account/quota/openai.ts`
   - Responsibilities:
     - refresh expired Codex/OpenAI OAuth access tokens
     - maintain shared OpenAI display cache (`OPENAI_QUOTA_DISPLAY_TTL_MS = 60_000`) for TUI footer and `/admin`
     - call `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`
     - normalize usage windows into footer-friendly remaining percentages (`hourlyRemaining`, `weeklyRemaining`, `hasHourlyWindow`)
   - Backend route `packages/opencode/src/server/routes/account.ts` exposes `/account/quota` for web consumption.

4. **Caching / load-shedding contract**
   - OpenAI quota fetching uses in-process cache (`quotaCache`) with 5-minute TTL and stale-while-revalidate behavior.
   - This means UI-triggered refresh does **not** imply a guaranteed remote usage API call every time; cached quota may be served immediately while refresh happens only when stale.
   - Architectural goal: preserve operator-visible freshness after actual AI usage while keeping CPU/network cost bounded.

#### C) Backend provider graph assembly (canonical order)

`provider/provider.ts` state initialization is conceptually:

1. Load models registry (`models.dev` + snapshot) into provider database.
2. Apply provider-specific manual correction layer to raw model feeds (remove known-bad upstream entries, add curated missing entries).
3. Merge config providers and aliases.
4. Merge env/auth-derived provider options.
5. Merge provider-keyed account inventory from `Account.listAll()` into account-scoped provider entries.
6. Apply plugin/custom loaders.
7. Apply model/provider filtering (ignored/deprecated/disabled/rate-limit aware checks).

Implementation note:

- several internals still use legacy names like `family`, `knownFamilies`, and `storage.families` for compatibility
- however, current design intent should be read as:
  - provider key = account-bearing boundary
  - model family = model catalog grouping only
  - legacy `family` names are compatibility wrappers, not a semantic license to route by model-family abstraction

This order guarantees provider-owned model catalogs are assembled first, then account- and plugin-specific behavior is overlaid.

#### D) Provider resolution and identity boundaries

To enforce 3D identity boundaries:

- Auth/account resolution must treat the canonical **provider** as the first operational key.
- Some legacy helper/API names still use `family`, but in current cms architecture that layer should be interpreted as a provider-resolution compatibility shim, not as the primary business concept.
- Resolution order remains deterministic for backward compatibility:
  - exact provider match
  - account-id pattern-derived provider
  - longest known provider prefix
- Account load now normalizes legacy/non-canonical provider keys (example: `nvidia-work` → `nvidia`) and preserves data during merge.
- Deprecated fallback behavior that treated arbitrary dashed IDs as valid provider IDs was reduced.
- Canonical resolver API is still the primary runtime path:
  - `Account.resolveFamily(providerId)`
  - `Account.resolveFamilyOrSelf(providerId)`
- Despite the historical method names above, new logic should conceptually read them as **provider resolution APIs**.
- Provider-level UI inventory is now separated from runtime account-scoped provider entries:
  - canonical UI provider source: `packages/opencode/src/provider/canonical-family-source.ts`
  - current first consumer: TUI `/admin` root/provider list in `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/component/dialog-admin.tsx`
  - rule: UI provider lists consume canonical provider rows only; account-scoped provider IDs remain internal runtime coordinates for account/model execution paths.
  - backend `/provider` route (`packages/opencode/src/server/routes/provider.ts`) now emits provider rows from the same canonical source so web consumers can converge on the same provider inventory.

#### D.1) Identity invariants (must hold)

1. **No fuzzy provider parsing in runtime decisions**
   - Model routing, fallback, health checks, and provider route composition must use canonical resolver API.
2. **Provider is operational; account is scoped; model family is descriptive**
   - `provider-id` and `account-id` are execution coordinates; model family is catalog metadata and must not override provider/account truth.
3. **Storage self-heals legacy provider keys**
   - On account load and explicit migration, non-canonical keys are normalized and merged without silent data loss.
4. **Operational migration is explicit**
   - `opencode auth migrate-identities` provides a reportable/manual path to normalize identity drift.

#### D.2) Refactor coverage and verification gates

This refactor is not limited to `Auth` or `Account`; canonical identity resolution was propagated to all major provider decision paths:

- Session model routing/fallback (`session/llm.ts`, `session/processor.ts`, `session/image-router.ts`)
- Provider health and availability checks (`provider/health.ts`)
- Provider API composition (`server/routes/provider.ts`)
- Rotation and scoring (`account/rotation3d.ts`, `agent/score.ts`)
- Runtime provider inheritance (`provider/provider.ts`) — legacy regex inheritance removed and replaced with resolver-based inheritance.

To prevent regressions for the original NVIDIA admin issue, the project now includes both test and script-level gates:

- Regression tests:
  - `packages/opencode/test/auth/family-resolution.test.ts`
  - `packages/opencode/test/account/family-normalization.test.ts`
  - `packages/opencode/test/provider/provider-cms.test.ts` (includes admin-like NVIDIA flow)
- Scripted E2E tester:
  - `scripts/test-e2e-provider-nvidia-admin.ts`
  - Verifies: add NVIDIA API account → activate account → provider model list visible → model resolvable
  - **Non-polluting cleanup guarantee**: tester always removes temporary `e2e-*` account and restores previous active account in `finally`.

Autonomous progress narration now uses assistant text-part metadata (`excludeFromModel`) so transcript-visible status notes can remain user-visible without being replayed back into model context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | `MessageV2`, `Part`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **In:** Raw Data<br>**Out:** Typed Message                                                                        |
| `src/session/todo.ts`                | **Todo Store.** Persists session todo lists and now supports optional structured action-plan metadata so autonomous planning can consume explicit action kind/risk/waiting/dependency signals instead of relying only on freeform todo text. The runtime enriches missing action metadata on write, and now also provides minimal dependency-ready selection plus task-result-driven auto-advance/reconciliation for autonomous step progression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `Todo`, `update`, `get`, `inferActionFromContent`, `nextActionableTodo`, `reconcileProgress`                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **In:** SessionID + todos<br>**Out:** Persisted todo state                                                        |
| `src/session/prompt.ts`              | **Prompt Loop.** Entry point for the main agent execution loop (tools/reasoning). Hosts the in-process autonomous continuation hook, transcript-visible autonomous narration, and interrupt-safe runtime replacement for new user prompts that supersede a busy autonomous synthetic run. It now also emits explicit replanning narration when a real user message interrupts the autonomous loop, and ignores narration-only synthetic assistant messages when deciding whether the loop already has a terminal reply. It also preserves explicit subtask model hints when handing work to `TaskTool`, so command/subtask-specified models are not silently replaced downstream.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `SessionPrompt`, `prompt`, `loop`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **In:** User Input<br>**Out:** Execution Result                                                                   |

Runtime entries are now keyed by per-run identity so replacement of a busy autonomous run can abort the old loop while preventing the old loop's deferred cleanup from clearing the new one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `start`, `finish`, `cancel`, runtime helpers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **In:** SessionID + runtime lifecycle<br>**Out:** Active run ownership / callbacks                                |
| `src/session/workflow-runner.ts`     | **Autonomous Workflow Runner.** Evaluates whether a session should auto-continue, writes synthetic continuation prompts, persists pending continuation records, runs the in-process supervisor/resume scan for idle autonomous sessions, and can switch autonomous synthetic main turns onto a better-fit operational model for the current agent domain before persisting the next user step. It attaches the latest main-turn model arbitration trace onto synthetic user-part metadata for observability, applies fairness scheduling plus provider-family budget buckets, maintains a minimal supervisor contract with lease ownership/retry/classified failures, and includes a lightweight planner/executor contract that chooses between continuing in-progress work, starting dependency-ready pending work, waiting on active subagents, or stopping for explicit approval/product-decision blockers and `requireApprovalFor` safety gates. The planner now prefers structured todo action metadata over plain-text heuristics when available, only gates on dependency-ready work, returns the active todo for narration, and exposes a pure interrupt gate used when real user input should preempt a busy autonomous run. Resume scheduling now also penalizes repeatedly failing sessions when readiness is otherwise equal, and retry scheduling for provider rate limits aligns with provider-family/model bucket wait time instead of plain exponential backoff alone. | `decideAutonomousContinuation`, `planAutonomousNextAction`, `describeAutonomousNextAction`, `detectApprovalRequiredForTodos`, `enqueueAutonomousContinue`, `resumePendingContinuations`, `pickPendingContinuationsForResume`, `computeResumeBackoffMs`, `computeResumeRetryAt`, `classifyResumeFailure`, queue helpers | **In:** Session workflow + todo state<br>**Out:** Continue decision / pending continuation record / resumed loop  |
| `src/session/smart-runner-governor.ts` | **Smart Runner Governor.** Session-level LLM governance layer that evaluates autonomous continuation decisions. Produces structured decisions (`continue / replan / ask_user / request_approval / pause_for_risk / pause / complete / docs_sync_first / debug_preflight_first`) with confidence, narration, and next-action metadata.

| `src/session/model-orchestration.ts` | **Session Model Orchestration.** Centralizes domain-aware model selection rules shared by autonomous main turns and subagent dispatch. Applies precedence `explicit > agent pinned > scored domain candidate > fallback model`, checks rate-limit / account-health / provider-health signals, can request a Rotation3D rescue fallback when the preferred candidate is not operational, and emits a compact arbitration trace that can be surfaced in UI metadata.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `domainForAgent`, `shouldAutoSwitchMainModel`, `orchestrateModelSelection`, `selectOrchestratedModel`, `resolveProviderModel`                                                                                                                                                                                          | **In:** Agent name + explicit/agent/fallback models<br>**Out:** Resolved model/model instance + arbitration trace |

| `src/pages/session/session-side-panel.tsx`        | **Shared Sidebar Status Surface.** The reusable session sidebar that already hosts Files / Status / Changes / Context modes. Its Status mode is the canonical place to converge todo progress, task monitor activity, workflow blockers, transcript-derived latest narration, and supervisor debug visibility for both TUI/Web-style interaction flows.                                                                                 | `SessionSidePanel`                            | **In**: Session view-model + sync stores<br>**Out**: Shared sidebar status/files/context UI      |
| `src/pages/session/status-todo-list.tsx`          | **Todo Progress View.** Renders persisted session todos in the sidebar Status mode.

#### Session page shell contract (`packages/app`)

The web session UI now uses a single canonical page shell centered on `packages/app/src/pages/session.tsx`.

1. **Single page implementation**
   - `pages/session.tsx` is the only authoritative session page implementation.
   - `pages/session/index.tsx` exists only as a forwarding compatibility module and must not carry its own page logic.

2. **Pane topology**
   - **Main conversation pane**: message timeline + prompt dock.
   - **File pane**: dedicated file-view surface for opened file tabs.
   - **Tool sidebar**: right-side tool surface for `changes`, `context`, `files`, and `status` modes.
   - **Terminal panel**: separate bottom panel; not merged into the right sidebar system.

3. **Canonical shell API**
   - `layout.view(sessionKey).filePane` is the canonical open/close/toggle API for the file-view pane.
   - `layout.view(sessionKey).reviewPanel` remains as a temporary compatibility alias only; new work should use `filePane`.

4. **Naming boundary**
   - Shell-layer naming distinguishes:
     - `filePane` = opened file viewer container
     - `changesPanel` = diff/review content rendered inside the tool sidebar
   - Domain-level review concepts such as `SessionReviewTab` and `commentOrigin: "review"` remain valid and were not renamed as part of shell cleanup.

## 12. Configuration & Provider State Architecture (Normative)

This section defines the authoritative behavior for runtime config and provider visibility in `cms`.

### A. Runtime Config Source of Truth

1. Runtime configuration for provider enable/disable is **global-scope only**.
2. Project-level `.opencode/opencode.json(c)` is **not part of runtime merge** in this build.
3. Admin/TUI mutations must write to global config via runtime-safe update flow.

**Primary files**

- `packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/context/sync.tsx`

### B. Provider State Semantics

1. `disabled` and `hidden` are the same product concept for provider visibility.
2. Provider visibility is controlled by `config.disabled_providers`.
3. Disabled providers are excluded from filtered provider list and shown in Show All as disabled.

**Primary files**

- `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/component/dialog-admin.tsx`
- `packages/opencode/src/provider/provider.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/plugin/index.ts`

### C. Admin Providers List Modes

1. **Filtered mode (default)**: show enabled providers only.
2. **Show All mode**: show full provider set (enabled + disabled).
3. Both modes must use the same underlying provider universe; mode difference is filtering only.

### D. Toggle Behavior Contract

1. In provider root list, toggle action must update enable/disable state in both modes.
2. Root-level provider toggle uses `Space` as the canonical action; root `Delete` path is disabled/hidden.
3. Toggle success must update:
   - persisted config (`disabled_providers`)
   - in-memory runtime state
   - rendered list/status in current mode

### E. Event/Refresh Contract

1. After config mutation, instance disposal must complete before subsequent reads bootstrap new state.
2. TUI sync must refresh on:
   - `server.instance.disposed`
   - `global.disposed`

### F. Debugging Checklist (Provider Toggle)

If toast says success but UI does not change, verify in order:

1. `disabled_providers` actually changed in effective runtime config.
2. TUI sync received disposed event and re-bootstrapped state.
3. Provider list mode logic is filtering correctly (Show All vs filtered).
4. Status label and filter both read from the same disabled source.

## 13. Provider Toggle and Tool-Call Bridge Architecture

This section defines the current provider visibility/toggle architecture and tool-call bridge behavior for `/admin` and runtime provider normalization.

### A. Provider Toggle Behavior

1. Unified semantics:
   - `disable == hide`
   - `enable == show`
2. `Show All` is full list (no visibility filter).
3. `Filtered` mode only shows enabled providers.
4. Root-level provider toggle uses `Space` as primary action; root `Delete` path is disabled/hidden.

**Primary file**

- `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/component/dialog-admin.tsx`

### B. UX/State Consistency

1. Resolved stale/slow visual updates with optimistic provider-state updates.
2. Toggle success is reflected immediately in UI; persistence and bootstrap run in background.
3. Removed duplicate footer action label in root provider list.
4. Fixed `Show All` disappearing item regression after toggle.

### C. Config and Refresh Reliability

1. Runtime provider toggle writes through server global-config API path.
2. Post-update refresh chain is aligned with sync event handling.
3. TUI sync listens to both instance and global disposal events for refresh convergence.

**Primary files**

- `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/component/dialog-admin.tsx`
- `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/context/sync.tsx`
- `packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts`

### D. Guardrail

Any future provider-toggle refactor must preserve:

1. Single source for disabled state (`disabled_providers`).
2. `Show All`/`Filtered` list parity except filter.
3. Disabled Antigravity plugin path must not initialize auth plugin hooks.

### E. Tool Call Bridge Generalization

1. Response rewrite logic for text-protocol tool calls is now routed through a generic Tool Call Bridge manager.
2. Provider/model-specific matching (for example, GmiCloud DeepSeek) is isolated in bridge rule modules under `src/provider/toolcall-bridge/bridges/`.
3. Legacy compatibility exports are preserved via `src/provider/gmicloud-toolcall-bridge.ts` to avoid breaking existing call sites and tests.
4. The generic OpenAI chat rewriter and protocol parser are reusable for future providers that emit textual tool-call markers.

**Primary files**

- `packages/opencode/src/provider/provider.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/provider/toolcall-bridge/index.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/provider/toolcall-bridge/bridges/gmicloud-deepseek.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/provider/toolcall-bridge/openai-chat-rewriter.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/provider/toolcall-bridge/protocol/text-protocol.ts`
- `packages/opencode/src/provider/gmicloud-toolcall-bridge.ts`
- `packages/opencode/test/provider/toolcall-bridge/manager.test.ts`

## 14. External Dependency Architecture

This section inventories current external dependency surfaces for the `cms` branch and clarifies where dependency resolution happens at runtime vs build time.

### A. Dependency Layers (Where dependencies are actually resolved)

1. **Monorepo build/install layer**
   - Source: root `package.json` + workspace package manifests.
   - Manager: Bun workspace (`workspaces`, `catalog`, `overrides`, `patchedDependencies`).
   - Resolution timing: `bun install` in repo.

2. **Runtime user-space layer (dynamic, outside repo)**
   - Source: user directories (`~/.config/opencode`, `~/.local/share/opencode`) and optional custom config dir.
   - Manager: `Config.installDependencies()` in `packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts`.
   - Resolution timing: during runtime bootstrap (tool/plugin loading flow), not only during repo development.

3. **Template bootstrap layer**
   - Source: `templates/package.json` and `.opencode/package.json` templates.
   - Purpose: define default runtime dependencies for initialized user environments.

### B. Monorepo External Dependency Profile (high-level)

1. **AI/provider SDK cluster (core runtime heavy coupling)**
   - Root depends on many provider adapters under `@ai-sdk/*` (Anthropic/OpenAI/Google/Bedrock/Groq/etc.) and MCP/ACP stacks.
   - Architectural implication: provider availability and transport compatibility are external-SDK sensitive.

2. **UI/desktop cluster**
   - `packages/app` depends on Solid ecosystem + rendering/markdown/highlight stack.
   - `packages/desktop` depends on Tauri plugin suite (`@tauri-apps/*`).
   - Architectural implication: desktop release stability is tied to Tauri plugin matrix compatibility.

3. **Console/backend cluster**
   - `packages/console/core` and `packages/console/function` depend on Drizzle/Postgres/Stripe/AWS/OpenAuth stacks.
   - Architectural implication: cloud/service API version drift can affect serverless and billing/auth flows.

4. **Dependency governance mechanisms already present**
   - `catalog:` centralizes many versions.
   - `overrides` pins critical transitive behavior.
   - `patchedDependencies` currently includes `ghostty-web@0.3.0` patch path.

### C. Runtime Dynamic Dependencies (hidden coupling hotspots)

1. **Auto-install path exists in runtime config pipeline**
   - `Config.state()` iterates runtime config directories and calls `installDependencies(dir)`.
   - `installDependencies()` rewrites/ensures `package.json` dependency:
     - `"@opencode-ai/plugin": targetVersion`
   - `targetVersion = Installation.isLocal() ? "*" : Installation.VERSION`.

2. **Version-coupling risk**
   - When `Installation.VERSION` is a custom/non-published build tag (e.g., `0.0.0-cms-*`), runtime install can fail because npm registry has no matching `@opencode-ai/plugin` release.
   - This is a runtime bootstrap coupling, not a monorepo compile-time failure.

3. **Current runtime manifests (observed)**
   - `~/.config/opencode/package.json`
   - `~/.local/share/opencode/package.json`
   - Both are active dependency manifests used by runtime bootstrap.

### D. Template & User-Space Dependency Surfaces

1. `templates/package.json`
   - Includes:
     - `@opencode-ai/plugin`
     - `opencode-openai-codex-auth-multi`
2. `.opencode/package.json` (repo template/runtime scaffold)
   - Includes floating `@opencode-ai/plugin: "*"`.

Architectural implication: user runtime behavior depends not only on repo lockfile, but also on template-emitted manifests and post-install mutation logic.

### E. Coupling Risk Classification (inventory only)

1. **High risk**
   - Runtime pinning of internal package to non-published version identifiers.
   - Floating `*` specifiers in runtime manifests.

2. **Medium risk**
   - Pre-release/timestamped package references (for example OpenAuth prerelease line).
   - URL-based package source in catalog (e.g. preview channel dependencies).

3. **Operational risk**
   - Runtime dependency state split across repo + user directories can produce environment-specific failures that are not reproducible from repo lockfile alone.

### F. Current Conclusion

The project has **three dependency planes** (monorepo, template, runtime user-space), and the most failure-prone area is the runtime plane where dependency versions are mutated during bootstrap. This is the primary external-coupling boundary to target in the next decoupling plan.

---

## 15. External Dependency Decoupling Plan (Draft v1)

This plan aims to reduce runtime dependency fragility while preserving compatibility for current users.

### A. Objectives

1. Eliminate runtime breakage caused by non-published internal package version pins.
2. Reduce hidden dependency drift between repo lockfile and user-space manifests.
3. Keep bootstrap behavior deterministic and diagnosable.

### B. Scope Boundaries

1. **In scope**
   - Runtime dependency installation policy in `Config.installDependencies()`.
   - Template/runtime manifest default version policy.
   - Health checks and telemetry for dependency resolution outcomes.

2. **Out of scope (for v1)**
   - Full removal of runtime plugin extensibility.
   - Re-architecting provider SDK selection model.

### C. Phased Rollout

#### Phase 0 — Safety Guard (Immediate, low risk)

1. Before writing runtime `@opencode-ai/plugin` version:
   - Validate target version format and publish availability.
2. If target is non-resolvable:
   - Fallback to a known-safe version policy (priority: template-pinned version -> latest stable allowed by policy).
3. Emit structured warning/event with cause and chosen fallback.

**Exit criteria**: no startup hard-fail caused by non-published plugin specifier.

#### Phase 1 — Version Source Decoupling (Short-term)

1. Stop direct coupling `pluginVersion := Installation.VERSION` for non-local channels.
2. Introduce explicit plugin resolution strategy:
   - `runtimePluginVersionPolicy` in config (e.g., `pinned`, `range`, `latest-safe`).
3. Resolve plugin version via policy module, not inline conditional.

**Exit criteria**: custom app version tags (`0.0.0-cms-*`) no longer imply same plugin version tag.

#### Phase 2 — Runtime Manifest Governance (Mid-term)

1. Replace floating `*` in runtime/template manifests with policy-driven ranges.
2. Add manifest provenance metadata (who/when/why updated dependency pins).
3. Add `opencode doctor deps` (or equivalent) to display effective dependency state across:
   - repo
   - global config dir
   - global data dir

**Exit criteria**: operators can inspect and reproduce dependency state deterministically.

#### Phase 3 — Optional Bundling / Offline Mode (Long-term)

1. Evaluate bundling core plugin runtime with application release artifact.
2. Keep external plugin install path only for explicitly opt-in custom plugins.
3. Add offline bootstrap path that does not require npm resolution for core runtime.

**Exit criteria**: baseline startup no longer depends on network package resolution for core plugin path.

### D. Policy Proposal (Version Resolution)

Resolution order for `@opencode-ai/plugin` during runtime install:

1. Explicit admin-managed override (managed config).
2. Explicit user config override.
3. Template baseline pinned version.
4. Registry-validated stable fallback.

Hard rules:

1. Never write unresolved/non-published exact version to runtime manifest.
2. Never persist `*` for core runtime dependency in production channels.
3. Record fallback decision in logs/events for auditability.

### E. Risk & Rollback Strategy

1. **Risk**: stricter policy may block previously tolerated custom pins.
   - Mitigation: provide explicit escape hatch config with warning banner.
2. **Risk**: compatibility drift between template version and runtime fallback.
   - Mitigation: CI check to compare template baseline against allowed policy set.
3. **Rollback**:
   - Feature-flag dependency policy module.
   - Revert to legacy install behavior behind emergency env flag.

### F. Validation Matrix

1. Local channel (`Installation.isLocal() = true`) bootstrap.
2. CMS custom version channel (`0.0.0-cms-*`) bootstrap.
3. Managed config override + read-only directory behavior.
4. No-network / registry timeout scenario.
5. Existing user manifests with historical invalid pins.

### G. Deliverables for Implementation Sprint

1. `DependencyVersionResolver` module + unit tests.
2. Runtime install guard in `Config.installDependencies()`.
3. Template manifest policy update.
4. Dependency health report command or admin diagnostics panel entry.

## 17. Runtime Dependency Principle (Normative, cms)

This section defines the dependency boundary policy for runtime behavior in `cms`.

### A. Core Principle

1. Runtime must minimize direct dependency on external package registries.
2. Public LLM provider APIs are an explicit exception (business-required external connectivity).
3. Non-LLM core runtime path must remain bootable under registry/network instability.

### B. Required Runtime Behavior

1. **Bundle-first for core runtime dependencies**
   - Core plugin/runtime capabilities should be loaded from release-bundled artifacts first.
2. **External-optional for non-core extensions**
   - External plugin installation is opt-in and must not block baseline startup.
3. **No runtime speculative version coupling**
   - Runtime install logic must not derive package versions directly from app build tags (for example `0.0.0-cms-*`).
4. **Deterministic fallback policy**
   - On unresolved external dependency, runtime must fallback/degrade with warnings, not hard-fail bootstrap.

### C. Ticket Alignment Update (v1 -> bundle-first)

1. `TKT-003` (manifest policy)
   - Upgrade target: remove floating `*` and mark core dependency path as bundle-first.
2. `TKT-004` (diagnostics)
   - Must classify dependencies as:
     - `core-bundled`
     - `external-optional`
     - `external-required`
3. Add implementation focus to `TKT-001/002`:
   - resolver/guard should prefer non-network core path before any external resolution.

### D. Success Criteria

1. Baseline runtime startup works when npm registry is unavailable (excluding first-time optional extension install).
2. Core agent/session/tool path does not require live dependency fetch.
3. Dependency failures in optional extensions are isolated and observable.

## 18. Test Governance Rule: Retire Obsolete Tests (Normative)

As `cms` architecture evolves, test maintenance must distinguish between regressions and obsolete contracts.

### A. Core Rule

If a test validates behavior that is intentionally removed by current architecture, that test should be **retired** (delete or move to legacy suite), not force-fixed.

### B. Retirement Decision Criteria

A test is eligible for retirement when all conditions hold:

1. The behavior is explicitly replaced/disabled in current architecture policy (`specs/architecture.md`) or recorded event decisions.
2. The test asserts legacy contract semantics that no longer represent production responsibilities.
3. Keeping the test causes persistent false alarms and reduces CI signal quality.

### C. Allowed Actions

1. **Delete** test if capability is permanently removed.
2. **Move to legacy suite** gated by explicit flag (e.g., compatibility verification only).
3. **Rewrite** test to validate the new contract if the capability still exists with changed semantics.

### D. PR/Review Requirements

When retiring tests, PR must include:

1. Reason for retirement mapped to architecture/event record.
2. Replacement coverage (if any) for current behavior.
3. Confirmation that CI signal quality improves (lower flaky/false-fail surface).

## 19. Web Auth Credential Management Baseline

This section defines the credential-management baseline for self-hosted Web deployments.

### A. Security Policy

1. Runtime credential strategy is selected by `OPENCODE_AUTH_MODE` (`pam`/`htpasswd`/`legacy`/`auto`).
2. Current cms baseline is **PAM-first** (`OPENCODE_AUTH_MODE=pam`) for Linux self-host deployments.
3. Keep htpasswd and legacy env-password as explicit compatibility modes, not implicit defaults.
4. Browser auth flow uses session cookie + CSRF protection; no URL-embedded basic credentials.

### B. Runtime credential behavior by mode

1. `pam`: Linux PAM only (`su` PTY via `bun-pty`); no htpasswd or legacy env password check.
2. `htpasswd`: file-based hash verification only (`OPENCODE_SERVER_HTPASSWD` or `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD_FILE`).
3. `legacy`: `OPENCODE_SERVER_USERNAME + OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` only.
4. `auto` (compatibility): htpasswd → legacy env password → PAM (Linux only).

### C. File-to-function mapping

| File Path                                              | Function / Responsibility                                                                                                     | Architectural Impact                                                                      |

### D. Operational baseline for Docker self-host

1. Credential file location: `/opt/opencode/config/opencode/.htpasswd`
2. File format: one credential per line (`username:<argon2/bcrypt hash>`)
3. Do not ship default plaintext password values in compose defaults.

## 20. WebApp File Structure & Runtime Flow (cms)

This section provides the current architecture view focused on:

1. where core WebApp logic lives, and
2. how the runtime data/auth/terminal flows operate end-to-end.

### A. WebApp structure map (high-signal paths)

| Area                | Primary Files                                                                                                                                                                                     | Responsibility                                                                                                                                           |

### B. Runtime flow 1: Auth + API request path

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  B[Browser] --> C[AuthGate]
  C --> W[web-auth context\nauthorizedFetch + CSRF]
  W --> A[Server WebAuth middleware]
  A --> R[API routes /api/v2 + /global]
  R --> G[global-sdk/global-sync stores]
  G --> UI[Session + Settings UI]
```

Key contract:

- Browser path is cookie-session + CSRF.
- TUI/CLI compatibility may still use Basic auth where required.
- Pre-login event/SDK requests must be gated to avoid expected-but-noisy 401 loops.

### C. Runtime flow 2: Terminal / PTY lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  UI[Terminal UI] --> P1[POST /pty create]
  P1 --> P2[WS /pty/:id/connect]
  P2 --> BUF[Terminal renderer\ncontrol frame vs payload frame]
  BUF --> STORE[terminal context state]
  STORE --> UI
```

Required invariants:

1. PTY uses explicit create -> connect contract; stale IDs are invalid state.
2. Hydrated persisted PTY IDs must be validated/pruned on startup.
3. WebSocket handling must separate metadata control frames from renderable payload frames.
4. Popout/inline transitions use `skipRestore` policy to avoid stale-frame replay artifacts.

### C1. Workspace-scoped app state ownership (current beta/cms direction)

The web app currently uses a mixed ownership model while the new workspace kernel is being rolled out:

1. **Workspace-owned state**
   - `context/terminal.tsx`
   - `context/global-sync/child-store.ts`
   - These states now key off explicit workspace directory truth, not just raw route params.

2. **Session-with-workspace-default state**
   - `context/prompt.tsx`
   - `context/comments.tsx`
   - `context/file/view-cache.ts`
   - Rule: if a session id exists, keep per-session scope; otherwise fall back to the explicit workspace directory derived by `globalSync.child(directory).workspace`.

3. **Why this matters**
   - The app no longer treats every persistence surface as a plain directory string.
   - `global-sync` is now the first consumer-facing bridge between runtime workspace modeling and app-side persistence scope.
   - This is still an intermediate phase: runtime owns the canonical workspace kernel under `packages/opencode/src/project/workspace/*`, while app/runtime now share identity normalization via `@opencode-ai/util/workspace`.

### C2. Workspace Abstraction Layer (authoritative current-state contract)

Workspace is no longer just a sidebar label or normalized directory string. The intended architecture is an explicit **execution scope aggregate** that sits between project/worktree boundaries and higher-level app/session UX.

#### Canonical entities

1. **Project**
   - Source of repo/worktree truth.
   - Canonical root boundary comes from `Project.Info.worktree` and project metadata.

2. **Workspace**
   - Canonical runtime aggregate defined by `packages/opencode/src/project/workspace/types.ts`.
   - Identity fields:
     - `workspaceId`
     - `projectId`
     - `directory`
     - `kind` = `root | sandbox | derived`
   - State fields:
     - `origin`
     - `lifecycleState`
     - `displayName`
     - `branch`
     - `attachments`

3. **Session**
   - Remains a session-domain object, but is attached to a workspace via `attachments.sessionIds` and `attachments.activeSessionId`.
   - A session is therefore **workspace-affiliated**, not itself the owner of workspace-wide runtime state.

4. **Workspace attachments**
   - Ownership model currently distinguishes:
     - `workspace`
     - `session`
     - `session_with_workspace_default`
   - Attachment summary includes:
     - `sessionIds`
     - `ptyIds`
     - `previewIds`
     - `workerIds`
     - `draftKeys`
     - `fileTabKeys`
     - `commentKeys`

#### Architectural purpose

The workspace layer exists to solve a class of scope/ownership problems that `directory` alone cannot express:

- root vs sandbox vs derived execution scope
- session affiliation inside the same worktree
- PTY / worker / preview / comments / file-tab ownership
- lifecycle transitions (`active`, `resetting`, `deleting`, `archived`, `failed`)
- future workspace-scoped routing, cleanup, and attribution policies

#### Runtime authority split

1. **Runtime kernel is authoritative**
   - `packages/opencode/src/project/workspace/*`
   - Responsible for identity, registry lookup, lifecycle transitions, attachment summaries, and workspace event publication.

2. **App is a consumer, not the source-of-truth**
   - `packages/app/src/context/global-sync/bootstrap.ts` consumes `/api/v2/workspace/current`
   - `packages/app/src/context/global-sync/event-reducer.ts` consumes live `workspace.*` events
   - App-side adapters may normalize/persist UI state, but should not invent conflicting workspace identity rules.

3. **Directory remains an input, not the final model**
   - Directory is the lookup key used to resolve the workspace aggregate.
   - Once resolved, downstream consumers should prefer workspace aggregate truth over raw path heuristics whenever scope/ownership matters.

#### Data flow (current intended direction)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  DIR[Request / directory] --> RESOLVE[WorkspaceService.resolve]
  RESOLVE --> REG[Workspace registry]
  REG --> AGG[WorkspaceAggregate]
  AGG --> API[/workspace/current / /workspace/status]
  AGG --> EVT[workspace.created/updated/lifecycle.changed/attachment.*]
  API --> BOOT[global-sync bootstrap]
  EVT --> REDUCER[global-sync event reducer]
  BOOT --> CHILD[directory child store]
  REDUCER --> CHILD
  CHILD --> APP[terminal / prompt / comments / file-view / layout]
```

#### Ownership rules by surface

1. **Workspace-owned**
   - terminal / PTY tabs
   - workspace aggregate itself
   - lifecycle/busy state for reset/delete flows

2. **Session-owned**
   - session messages
   - todo / permission / question state
   - message-derived review details

3. **Session-with-workspace-default**
   - prompt draft
   - comments
   - file-view cache
   - future UX that should survive session switches inside the same workspace unless an explicit session scope exists

#### Dirty/review/file-change boundary (important)

Current review/diff ownership now follows a split contract: runtime owns both raw git working-tree truth and session-owned attribution, while app/TUI own presentation and local caching behavior.

1. **Workspace layer owns affiliation and execution-scope truth**
   - which sessions belong to which workspace
   - which runtime artifacts are attached to that workspace

2. **Session layer may summarize message-local diffs**
   - useful for turn review/history
   - not sufficient by itself to act as the long-term authoritative source for session-owned dirty attribution

3. **Canonical per-session UI `Changes` source is current-dirty session attribution**
   - current API surface: `session.diff` without `messageID`
   - semantics: first derive session-owned candidate files from assistant write/apply-patch targets intersected with latest user-turn summary diffs, then query current git dirty state only for that candidate file set
   - TUI / webapp session `Changes` / `檔案異動` / dirty count surfaces should consume this source so each session only counts files it currently owns and that remain uncommitted

4. **Raw workspace git truth remains separate**
   - current API surface: `file.status`
   - semantics: all current uncommitted files for the resolved workspace directory
   - useful as a lower-level primitive and for diagnostics, but too broad for per-session UI counts

5. **Message-level review remains separate**
   - `session.diff` with `messageID` continues to mean summarized diff for that specific user turn
   - this is review/history data, not the same thing as current workspace dirty ownership

#### Invalidation / refresh contract

1. Bootstrap hydrates the initial workspace snapshot.
2. `workspace.*` SSE events update child-store workspace state incrementally.
3. Session-local caches (messages, diffs, todos, permissions, questions) remain separate from workspace aggregate state.
4. If a feature needs ownership truth across sessions in the same worktree, it should first ask whether the answer belongs in workspace runtime/service rather than another app-only cache.

### D. Runtime flow 3: Model selector and admin-lite parity path

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  S[DialogSelectModel] --> M[model-selector-state.ts]
  M --> PR[Provider rows]
  M --> AR[Account rows]
  M --> MR[Model rows]
  MR --> ACT[Apply: set active account -> set model]
  ACT --> SYNC[global dispose/bootstrap refresh]
```

Behavior boundary (current cms WebApp):

1. Provider/account rows derive from provider universe + provider-keyed account inventory.
2. Mode switch (`favorites`/`all`) affects model filtering layer only.
3. Unavailable/cooldown states are surfaced and selection is blocked with explicit reason.
4. Web has admin-lite parity slices; TUI `/admin` remains canonical full control plane.

### E. Smart Runner session-governance architecture

Smart Runner is now a **session-level LLM governance layer**, not the primary assistant speaking role.

It should be modeled as four cooperating layers:

1. **Main Agent / visible assistant**
   - still owns the user-facing assistant response stream
   - remains the canonical conversation actor
   - may emit normal assistant/tool output and narration

2. **Deterministic host / prompt loop**
   - implemented primarily in `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt.ts`
   - owns actual execution side effects:
     - message writes
     - question lifecycle entry
     - todo mutation
     - queueing autonomous continuation
     - workflow-state transitions
   - Smart Runner never bypasses this host layer

3. **Workflow runner / continuation gate**
   - implemented primarily in `packages/opencode/src/session/workflow-runner.ts`
   - remains the deterministic authority for whether a session may continue, stop, wait, or complete
   - emits the baseline `decision.continue + reason + text + todo` contract that Smart Runner may observe and refine, but not replace arbitrarily

4. **Smart Runner governor**
   - implemented primarily in `packages/opencode/src/session/smart-runner-governor.ts`
   - uses LLM reasoning in dry-run/governance mode over:
     - recent messages
     - todo graph
     - deterministic continuation decision
     - session health / pending questions / approvals
   - produces governance metadata, not direct unchecked side effects

Current product position:

- Smart Runner **is** an LLM-backed agent layer
- but it is specifically a **governor / advisor / bounded co-pilot** for session workflow
- not a second primary assistant persona
- not an unrestricted autonomous executor

### F. Smart Runner proposal and adoption contract

The current Smart Runner contract has four distinct output levels:

1. **Trace**
   - every dry-run governance evaluation can be persisted as a Smart Runner trace
   - trace is the durable observability layer for later UI/debug/history inspection

2. **Suggestion**
   - Smart Runner may emit structured suggestions such as:
     - `ask_user`
     - `replan`
   - suggestions are still advisory until host/runtime evaluates them

3. **Bounded assist**
   - low-risk continuation text/narration may be adjusted when policy allows
   - assist never rewrites the deterministic continuation gate itself into an unrelated action

4. **Host adoption**
   - certain suggestions may be adopted by deterministic host/runtime under explicit policy
   - current implemented adoption paths:
     - `ask_user`
     - `request_approval`
     - `replan`

Adoption policy principles:

- proposal policy is explicit (`trustLevel`, `adoptionMode`, `requiresUserConfirm`, `requiresHostReview`)
- host/runtime must still verify local gates before acting
- Smart Runner proposals do not directly mutate session state on their own

### G. Current implemented Smart Runner flows

#### 1. Ask-user adopted path

- Smart Runner may propose `ask_user`
- host/runtime evaluates adoption gates:
  - question text exists
  - policy is `user_confirm_required`
  - host review is still required
  - no pending question already exists for the session
- if adopted:
  - host persists trace/adoption metadata
  - host calls `Question.ask(...)`
  - on reply, host creates a synthetic user text turn and continues the loop
  - on reject, host persists rejection outcome and moves workflow to `waiting_user / product_decision_needed`

#### 2. Replan adopted path

- Smart Runner may propose `replan`
- host/runtime evaluates todo safety gates (dependency readiness, no conflicting in-progress todo, supported action/kind, no approval bypass)
- if adopted:
  - host updates todos deterministically
  - host immediately re-runs continuation evaluation
  - Smart Runner assist may still refine the resulting continue text within bounded rules

#### 3. Request-approval adopted path

- Smart Runner may propose `request_approval`
- host/runtime evaluates approval-adoption policy gates:
  - policy must remain `host_adoptable`
  - host review must still be required
  - no extra user-confirm precondition should exist before requesting approval itself
- if adopted:
  - host persists trace/adoption metadata
  - host transitions workflow to `waiting_user / approval_needed`
  - execution pauses without enqueuing another autonomous continue step

#### 4. Continue-branch side effects

- after deterministic continuation (possibly refined by Smart Runner adoption/assist), host/runtime still owns:
  - narration emission
  - autonomous continue enqueue
  - round-count advancement

### H. Smart Runner testability layering

The current test strategy intentionally avoids relying only on brittle full-loop mocks.

Coverage now exists at multiple layers:

1. **Governor unit tests**
   - proposal generation
   - host-adoption annotations
   - assist application boundaries

2. **Prompt-side helper tests**
   - ask-user question building
   - synthetic answer formatting
   - ask-user orchestration helper
   - replan orchestration helper
   - continuation side-effects helper

3. **Real question event-flow integration**
   - real `Question.ask/list/reply/reject` lifecycle exercised via prompt-side helpers

4. **High-level stop-decision regression**
   - `result === "stop" && decision.continue` Smart Runner branch is now factored into a dedicated high-level helper so the most important governance path can be tested without brittle module-cache mocking

This means current Smart Runner validation is already close to runLoop truth, even though a fully mocked end-to-end `SessionPrompt.loop()` regression is still considered future work.

### I. Deployment/runtime contract for WebApp correctness

1. Server should serve local frontend bundle via `OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH` for cms-consistent behavior.
2. If not set, CDN proxy fallback can produce frontend/runtime contract drift (auth and feature mismatch risk).
3. Operationally, direct web mode is primary for host-workspace parity; Docker remains optional isolation path.

## 21. Desktop Runtime Architecture

This section documents the desktop application's current operating principles. The desktop is a **thin Tauri shell** that loads the same web frontend served by `opencode serve`.

### A. Process Architecture (stdout-based sidecar)

```
Tauri Main Process (Rust, minimal)
  ├── Platform env setup (display backend, proxy bypass)
  ├── Spawns child: `opencode serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 [--port N]`
  │   with env: OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD={random UUID}
  │             OPENCODE_CLIENT=desktop
  │             OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH={bundled frontend resource}
  ├── Waits for stdout: "opencode server listening on http://..."
  │   (no HTTP health polling — parsed directly from stdout line)
  ├── Opens WebView → parsed server URL (External URL, not bundled HTML)
  │   with init script injecting auto-login credentials
  └── On exit: kill child process (RunEvent::Exit handler)

Child Process (Bun / opencode serve)
  ├── Hono HTTP server on localhost
  ├── API at /api/v2 and /
  ├── Frontend served from OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH (bundled in Tauri resources)
  └── SSE event stream at /event
```

**Port selection**: `OPENCODE_PORT` env → explicit `--port N` → port 0 (OS-assigned, reported via stdout).

**Readiness detection**: `cli.rs` reads the child's stdout line-by-line. When a line starts with `SERVER_READY_PREFIX` (`"opencode server listening on http://"`), the URL is parsed from that line and sent via a oneshot channel. Timeout: 30s → error dialog.

**Auto-login**: `windows.rs` injects `window.__OPENCODE__.autoLoginCredentials = { username, password }` via WebView initialization script. The web frontend's `AuthGate` component picks this up on mount and calls `auth.login()` automatically — no login form shown.

### B. Frontend Architecture (web-unified)

Desktop now loads the **same web frontend** (`packages/app/src/entry.tsx`) served by the opencode server, rather than a separate Tauri-specific entry. The WebView points to the server's HTTP URL (`WebviewUrl::External`).

**What this eliminates** (compared to the pre-refactor architecture):

- Desktop-specific `index.tsx` with 15+ Platform interface methods
- Separate Vite build for desktop frontend
- `bindings.ts` fragility (fewer Tauri commands called from frontend)
- Tauri plugins for: dialog, store, notification, clipboard, http

**What remains in Rust**:

- Window creation with server URL + auto-login injection
- Auto-updater (`tauri-plugin-updater`)
- Deep linking (`tauri-plugin-deep-link`)
- Single instance enforcement
- Window state persistence (`tauri-plugin-window-state`)
- Linux display backend configuration (`main.rs`)
- macOS traffic light + overlay title bar styling

### C. Frontend Serving & Runtime Config (Fail-Fast)

The web server frontend path (`server/app.ts`) follows a **fail-fast** contract:

1. Runtime must provide **`OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH`** (configured from `/etc/opencode/opencode.cfg` in webctl/systemd flows).
2. If frontend bundle path is missing/invalid, server returns explicit errors (`503/404/400`) — **no silent CDN fallback**.
3. For SPA routes, server serves local `index.html` from the configured frontend root.

Canonical runtime source of truth for web/server launch parameters:

- **`/etc/opencode/opencode.cfg`**
  - Examples: `OPENCODE_PORT`, `OPENCODE_HOSTNAME`, `OPENCODE_PUBLIC_URL`, `OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH`, auth-related env.

Canonical launch paths:

- **Dev**: `./webctl.sh dev-start` (reads `/etc/opencode/opencode.cfg`, injects `OPENCODE_LAUNCH_MODE=webctl`)
- **Prod**: `./webctl.sh web-start` (systemd service with `EnvironmentFile=/etc/opencode/opencode.cfg`, injects `OPENCODE_LAUNCH_MODE=systemd`)
- **Mode-aware refresh shortcut**: `./webctl.sh restart` resolves to `dev-refresh` for active dev runtime, `web-refresh` for active production runtime, and refreshes both when both modes are active.
- Installed control-path calls still follow that same mode-preservation rule; success is defined by restart recovery back into the active mode, not by forcing a specific mode branch.
- **Dev restart cleanup contract**: the detached dev restart worker performs `stop -> flush -> start`; `flush` targets **stale interactive runtime trees** (including stale `opencode` / internal MCP trees), while explicitly excluding active webctl-tracked trees, live-TTY interactive roots, restart workers, and systemd-owned service trees. Broad bun-wide kill patterns remain forbidden.

Direct manual `opencode web` launch is guarded by launch-mode checks to prevent configuration drift.

**Desktop (Tauri)**: Bundles `packages/app/dist` as a Tauri resource at `frontend/`, sets `OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH` pointing to the resolved resource path at sidecar spawn time.

**Standalone CLI install** (`scripts/install/install`): Downloads `opencode-frontend.tar.gz` from the GitHub release and extracts to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/frontend/` for standalone distribution scenarios.

```
~/.local/share/opencode/
├── bin/opencode          ← CLI binary
├── frontend/             ← pre-built app dist (index.html, assets/, etc.)
│   ├── index.html
│   └── assets/
├── skills/               ← bundled skills
└── ...
```

Bundled skills are part of the runtime contract, not only documentation. The bootstrap posture is now **minimal-by-default**: `agent-workflow` remains the default workflow substrate, while skills such as `software-architect`, `model-selector`, `mcp-finder`, and `skill-finder` are routed on-demand instead of being implied bootstrap dependencies. In particular, `skills/agent-workflow/SKILL.md` now carries the autorunner-centered contract for conversation-to-plan conversion, structured todo metadata, stop gates, delegation-first execution, narration-as-visibility (not a pause boundary), interrupt-safe replanning, the standardized system-level debug contract, and the requirement to treat framework documentation as a persistent system model. `code-thinker` shares that same debug contract for high-risk code/debug tasks, while `doc-coauthoring` remains the documentation-agent workflow for keeping framework docs synchronized during development/debug work. Therefore any changes to those skills must be synchronized with their counterparts under `templates/skills/**`.

`specs/architecture.md` is the hard-coded long-lived framework document for this repo. It should capture module boundaries, runtime/data flows, state machines, core directory trees, and debug/observability maps. `docs/events/event_<date>_<topic>.md` is the task-local ledger for requirements, conversation highlights, checkpoints, decisions, validation, and architecture-sync results. Complex development/debug sessions should prefer these docs first, then source exploration.

### D. Initialization Flow (post-refactor)

1. **`main.rs`**: Set `NO_PROXY` for loopback; on Linux, configure display backend env vars.
2. **`lib.rs::run()`**: Register Tauri plugins + commands; spawn async `initialize()` task.
3. **`initialize()`**: Check for explicit port (`OPENCODE_PORT` or custom server URL) → spawn sidecar via `cli::serve()` → await stdout readiness signal → create `MainWindow` with `ServerReadyData { url, username, password }`.
4. **`MainWindow::create()`**: Build WebView with `WebviewUrl::External(server_url)`, inject auto-login credentials via initialization script.
5. **Web frontend `AuthGate`**: On mount, reads `window.__OPENCODE__.autoLoginCredentials`, calls `auth.login()`, renders app.

### E. Cross-Surface Comparison (TUI vs Web vs Desktop)

| Aspect              | TUI                                    | Web (`opencode web`)                                                           | Desktop (Tauri)                                   |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Server hosting      | In-process `Server.listen()` in worker | In-process `Server.listen()`                                                   | Separate child process (`opencode serve`)         |
| Frontend renderer   | Terminal (`@opentui/solid`)            | Browser (same-origin)                                                          | Tauri WebView (External URL to localhost)         |
| Frontend entry      | TUI-specific renderer                  | `packages/app/src/entry.tsx`                                                   | Same as web (served by child process)             |
| Auth model          | Env var password → in-process          | Cookie-session + CSRF                                                          | Auto-login via `window.__OPENCODE__` credentials  |
| Frontend resolution | N/A                                    | `OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH` (from `/etc/opencode/opencode.cfg`) → fail-fast error | Bundled Tauri resource → `OPENCODE_FRONTEND_PATH` |
| Process count       | 1 (main + worker thread)               | 1                                                                              | 2 (Tauri host + child)                            |
| Readiness detection | In-process (immediate)                 | In-process (immediate)                                                         | stdout line parsing (no HTTP polling)             |

### F. Platform-Specific Behavior

**Windows**:

- WebView2 custom data directory and proxy bypass for loopback (`--proxy-bypass-list=<-loopback>`).
- Overlay titlebar via `tauri-plugin-decorum`.

**macOS**:

- Private API enabled for improved scrolling (`macOSPrivateApi: true`).
- Overlay title bar with hidden title, traffic lights at `(12, 18)`.

**Linux / WSL**:

- WebKit env vars: `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER`, `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE`, `WEBKIT_FORCE_SANDBOX=0`, `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE`, `WEBKIT_DISABLE_ACCELERATED_2D_CANVAS`.
- Wayland detection with X11 fallback (respects `OC_ALLOW_WAYLAND` and stored preference).
- GTK gesture zoom handler removal via `PinchZoomDisable` plugin.

## 22. System Identity & PAM Authentication Architecture

This section details the current Systemd-based user isolation, PAM authentication logic, and authorization bypasses (TUI) used to securely manage user identity impersonation while preserving single-user and local terminal workflows.

### A. Architectural Goals

1. **Strict User Isolation (Web):** A centralized system daemon (`opencode` service) hosts the web UI but spawns processes (like Bash shells or LLM scripts) under the explicitly authenticated Linux user's identity.
2. **Native Environment (TUI):** A terminal user launching the TUI must have requests run seamlessly under their _current session identity_, bypassing web auth flows without escalating or switching privileges.
3. **No Sudo for Opencode Core:** The main server runs as a less-privileged or dedicated `opencode` user and delegates command execution down to the target user via a narrowly-scoped sudoers policy.

### B. Core Components & Responsibilities

| File / Component                                  | Responsibility                                                                                                                          | Impact                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/opencode/src/system/linux-user-exec.ts` | **Execution Bridge:** Intercepts shell creation and command execution. Decides whether to prefix commands with `sudo -u <target_user>`. | Centralizes the decision point for user impersonation logic.                                                       |
| `packages/opencode/src/runtime/request-user.ts`   | **Context Manager:** Holds the `username` associated with the _current asynchronous request/call stack_.                                | Enables deep functions (like PTY spawners) to know who originated the HTTP request without prop drilling.          |
| `packages/opencode/src/server/web-auth.ts`        | **PAM Authenticator:** Validates credentials via Node-PAM. On success, issues a signed session cookie containing the `username`.        | The sole gatekeeper for browser-to-server trust. Extracts Linux user info and injects it into the request context. |
| `packages/opencode/src/server/app.ts`             | **Auth Middleware:** Rejects unauthenticated requests. Parses session cookies or bypass tokens and populates `RequestUser`.             | Secures all backend routes from unauthorized web access.                                                           |
| `packages/opencode/src/server/killswitch/service.ts` | **KillSwitch Service:** Logic for state management, MFA, control distribution, and snapshots. | Core logic for the global emergency stop system. |
| `packages/opencode/src/server/routes/killswitch.ts` | **KillSwitch Routes:** API endpoints for status, trigger, and cancel actions. | Exposes the emergency stop system to operators. |
| `scripts/opencode-run-as-user.sh`                 | **Sudo Target Script:** A restricted script that executes a payload as the target user while loading their `.bashrc` / `.bash_profile`. | Ensures the shell and agents have the correct environment variables (Node, Git, IDE settings) for that user.       |

### C. The TUI Auth Bypass (`OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN`)

Because the TUI acts as a client to the local server, pushing it through the web's PAM authentication would require prompt interruptions or manual password entries on an already-authenticated terminal.

To solve this securely:

1. **Dynamic Token Generation (`packages/opencode/src/index.ts`)**: When the CLI starts, it dynamically generates an `OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN` (random crypto bytes) and sets it in the environment variable.
2. **Worker Injection (`packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/thread.ts`)**: The TUI worker process inherits this variable.
3. **Authorized Fetches (`packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/worker.ts`)**: The TUI worker attaches `Bearer <OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN>` to its local server requests instead of standard auth credentials.
4. **Server Bypass (`packages/opencode/src/server/app.ts`)**: The server's middleware intercepts `OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN`. If it matches the server's running token, the request is permitted **without a `username` context**.

### D. Execution Decision Matrix

When `linux-user-exec.ts` (`resolveExecutionUser`) evaluates how to run a command:

| Auth Method                | Origin         | `RequestUser` Username | Sudo Execution Action                                        | Reason                                                                      |
| :------------------------- | :------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PAM Session Cookie**     | Browser WebApp | `<logged_in_user>`     | `sudo -u <user> /usr/local/libexec/opencode-run-as-user ...` | Explicit login requires isolating execution to the selected identity.       |
| **`OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN`**   | Local TUI      | `undefined`            | Native Execution (No Sudo)                                   | TUI is already running under the active terminal user's system permissions. |
| **No Auth (Public Route)** | Any            | `undefined`            | N/A (Denied by Server)                                       | Unauthenticated endpoints cannot trigger execution.                         |

### E. Security & Deployment Posture

- **Sudoers Policy:** For the WebApp impersonation to work, the daemon user (e.g., `opencode`) must be granted passwordless sudo access _only_ to the execution bridge script (`/usr/local/libexec/opencode-run-as-user`), not arbitrary commands.
- **Token Secrecy:** `OPENCODE_CLI_TOKEN` only lives in volatile memory and the environment variables of child processes spawned by the immediate CLI invocation. It is never written to disk.
