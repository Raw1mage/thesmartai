# Architecture

## System Overview

OpenCode is a desktop/TUI/Webapp multi-interface platform for interacting with AI coding agents and various model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.).

## Core Architecture

- **Multi-Interface**: TUI (`cli/cmd/tui`), Desktop App, Webapp (`packages/app`), and CLI.
- **Unified Backend**: All interfaces communicate with a shared Node/Bun backend via the `@opencode-ai/sdk` or direct function calls.
- **Provider Abstraction**: Model interactions are abstracted through the `Provider` module. Product-visible provider universe is now registry-first: a repo-owned supported provider registry defines which canonical providers cms officially supports and may show in `/provider` or UI lists, while runtime/config/accounts/models sources only enrich those supported providers with state and model metadata.

Architecture Sync (2026-04-08, webapp voice input MVP): Verified (No doc changes). 依據：變更僅限 `packages/app/src/components/prompt-input.tsx` 既有前端互動接線，未新增或改寫模組邊界、跨層資料流、server/API contract 或 runtime state authority。

## Frontend Architecture

### Layered Structure

The frontend is built with Solid.js and uses a bottom-up dependency model:

- **Infrastructure layer**: API transport, EventSource/WebSocket listeners, and platform adapters.
- **Sync layer**: `GlobalSync` plus per-workspace stores act as the authoritative event-reduced state surface.
- **Control layer**: layout, permission, and command coordination for global UI behavior.
- **Feature layer**: prompt, file, and terminal domain logic.
- **UI layer**: pages and components that subscribe to reactive state and render only the required slices.

### Frontend Data Flow

- Backend events stream into the SDK, then into `GlobalSync`, where reducers update Solid stores.
- UI components consume fine-grained reactive state so updates stay localized.
- User actions flow through feature/control contexts into the SDK, with optimistic UI where required, then reconcile against server-driven events.

### Frontend State Rules

- Prefer local reactive primitives for local UI state.
- Use centralized stores only for shared or durable data.
- Maintain per-workspace child stores to isolate data and reduce unnecessary redraws.
- Use structured reconciliation for large collections so component identity and scroll position remain stable.

### Frontend File / Rich Content Surfaces

- `packages/app/src/pages/session/components/message-content.tsx` is the assistant text entry point and routes assistant markdown through the session rich-content stack.
- `packages/app/src/pages/session/file-tabs.tsx` is the file-tab authority surface; binary/image/SVG/PDF/markdown/text branches are resolved here before content is displayed. SVG/image detection must tolerate both MIME and extension evidence because file APIs may return SVG as text or with MIME parameters.
- `packages/mcp/system-manager/src/index.ts` `open_fileview` may convert `.docx` inputs into cached PDF previews under the source document tree before emitting the `fileview_open` KV event; `packages/opencode/src/file/index.ts` serves `.pdf` as base64 `application/pdf`, and `file-tabs.tsx` renders it through the browser PDF viewer so page layout is preserved while text remains selectable.
- `packages/app/src/pages/session.tsx` is also part of the file-tab control surface: file-open flows are expected to both append/open the tab and set the newly opened file tab active immediately so the visible file view matches the most recent file-list selection.
- Markdown file preview is no longer conceptually equivalent to generic source rendering: `.md` tabs may render through a preview-oriented rich markdown surface while retaining a source-mode fallback.
- Shared markdown rendering behavior for chat and markdown file preview is being centralized under session-page rich markdown helpers/components so safety/fallback policy stays consistent.
- Existing SVG file-viewer behavior remains the authority for rich SVG inspection; markdown/chat flows should route to that safe viewer path for full inspection rather than replacing it with arbitrary inline SVG injection.
- `packages/mcp/system-manager/src/index.ts` exposes `display_inline_image` for user-requested inline image previews from explicit image file paths. This is a tool-result display surface, not a replacement for the file-tab authority; it only accepts image MIME types and keeps arbitrary rich document inspection on the file-viewer path. SVG tool results use the opencode-owned `--- SVG: <title> ---` envelope, and `packages/ui/src/components/message-part.tsx` routes any matching tool output to the shared SVG block preview renderer from `packages/ui/src/components/diagram-tool.tsx`.
- Assistant response Markdown rendered by `packages/ui/src/components/session-turn.tsx` may receive an app-provided inline image adapter from `packages/app/src/pages/session/message-timeline.tsx`; clicking absolute local image links (`/path/to/file.{svg,png,jpg,jpeg,gif,webp}` or `file://...`) expands an image preview under the response using the existing file API and project-boundary checks.
- Embedded session streams reuse the canonical `SessionTurn` renderer instead of forking message rendering. `packages/ui/src/components/session-turn.tsx` exposes `variant="embedded"` for compact non-page surfaces, while `packages/app/src/pages/task-list/task-detail.tsx` owns the output shell through `SessionStreamPanel` (card/header/clear action/scroll owner/empty-error states). Global Dialog/Kobalte layers remain separate because they own focus trap, overlay, close, and aria semantics.
- Mobile/tool file browsing in `packages/app/src/pages/session/tool-page.tsx` has its own lightweight content surface; it must mirror image/SVG preview behavior for `image/*` MIME files instead of falling through to plain text rendering.

### Frontend Performance Rules

- Large file/message surfaces rely on virtual scrolling.
- Expensive derived views must stay memoized.
- Effects should use untracked access when reads are not meant to become dependencies.
- Page-level code paths should remain lazily loaded when possible.

### Frontend Source Map

- `packages/app/src/context/`: domain state and coordination.
- `packages/app/src/pages/session/`: session-page controller/hooks/components. This surface now also owns the emerging shared rich-markdown rendering path used by assistant message content and markdown file preview in file tabs.
- `packages/app/src/hooks/`: reusable frontend logic.

## Planner / Spec Repository Lifecycle

> **Transition in progress (2026-04-18)**: the legacy `/plans/` vs `/specs/` split is being superseded by the `plan-builder` skill (see `## plan-builder Skill Lifecycle` below). New plans go straight into `/specs/<slug>/` and carry a `.state.json` lifecycle file. Legacy `/plans/<slug>/` packages remain functional and are migrated on-touch — see the plan-builder launch event for details.

- **Active plan/build workspace**: dated plan packages now live under `/plans/` inside the repo worktree.
- **Global architecture SSOT**: `specs/architecture.md` remains the long-lived architecture document and is not part of any dated plan package.
- **Formalized specs**: post-implementation, post-commit, post-merge formalized feature specs belong under semantic per-feature roots in `/specs/`.
- **Promotion rule**: `/plans/` artifacts remain the active planning/build contract during execution. Outside beta finalize they do not automatically move into `/specs/`; however, the beta workflow now requires a post-merge closeout step: after the final `test/*` branch merge into `baseBranch`, the completed plan must be consolidated into the related semantic `/specs/` family in the authoritative docs repo/worktree.
- **Beta closeout fail-fast**: if the target semantic `/specs/` family for that post-merge consolidation is ambiguous or absent, workflow must stop and request explicit user direction; silent fallback creation of isolated spec roots is prohibited.
- **Current promoted package**: the completed builder quiz-guard / build-mode refactoring package was promoted from `/plans/20260321_build-mode-refactoring/`, then merged into the existing canonical semantic root `/specs/builder_framework/` because both roots describe the same builder framework topic; future work should use `/specs/builder_framework/` as the formal reference package.
- **Promoted codex runtime package**: the completed `plans/codex-efficiency/` and `plans/aisdk-refactor/` tracks were later promoted and merged into `/specs/_archive/codex/provider_runtime/`.
- **Promoted codex websocket package**: after user confirmation of completion, `plans/codex-websocket/` was promoted into `/specs/_archive/codex/websocket/` and removed from `/plans/`.
- **Unified codex semantic root**: Codex protocol-observation material lives under `/specs/_archive/codex/protocol/`; `specs/_archive/codex/` is now the unified semantic root for codex-related specs.
- **Legacy dated packages under `/specs/`**: these require explicit status-based triage; implemented packages belong in formalized spec roots, non-implemented packages belong in `/plans/`. Silent dual-root fallback is prohibited.

## plan-builder Skill Lifecycle

Launched 2026-04-18 to supersede the legacy `planner` skill (see `docs/events/event_2026-04-18_plan-builder_launch.md`).

- **Skill location**: `~/projects/skills/plan-builder/` (symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/plan-builder/`).
- **Single-folder model**: per-feature specs live at `/specs/<slug>/` from day 0 through archive. There is no separate `/plans/<slug>/` location under the new model. `/specs/architecture.md` continues to be the repo-wide architecture SSOT and is not per-feature.
- **State machine (`.state.json`)**: each spec folder carries a `.state.json` file whose `state` is one of `proposed`, `designed`, `planned`, `implementing`, `verified`, `living`, `archived`. The file also holds a `history` array recording every transition, sync checkpoint, migration, refactor snapshot, and rollback. Schema: `~/projects/skills/plan-builder/schemas/state.schema.json`.
- **Seven change modes**: `new`, `amend`, `revise`, `extend`, `refactor`, `sync`, `archive` (plus internal `promote`, `migration`, `refactor-rollback`). Mode selection is objective — based on which artifact layer a change touches — rather than subjective small/medium/large judgment.
- **State-aware validation**: `plan-validate.ts` only checks artifacts required for the current state. `plan-promote.ts` validates against the target state before a transition commits.
- **Mandatory sync checkpoint**: `beta-workflow` is the single automatic trigger for `plan-sync.ts`, invoked after every `tasks.md` checkbox toggle during build execution. Drift warns but does not block commits. Every sync run — clean or warned — is recorded in `.state.json.history`, giving auditor-grade change-management evidence (SOC 2 CC8.1).
- **Peaceful on-touch migration**: any plan-builder script operating on a legacy `plans/<slug>/` path auto-promotes the folder to `specs/<slug>/`. State is inferred from artifact combination per deterministic rules; failure to infer throws `StateInferenceError` rather than defaulting (AGENTS.md rule 1 compliance). `git mv` is used when files are tracked; plain `mv` when the source is untracked (with explicit log rationale). Snapshot of pre-migration content is preserved under `specs/<slug>/.archive/pre-migration-YYYYMMDD/`.
- **Three-layer history**: (1) inline delta markers (strikethrough / version prefix) for amend/revise/extend in Markdown artifacts, (2) section-level `[SUPERSEDED by DD-N]` tags for design decisions and requirements, (3) full artifact snapshot to `.history/refactor-YYYY-MM-DD/` for `refactor` mode, reversible via `plan-rollback-refactor.ts`.
- **Code-independence gap analysis**: `plan-gaps.ts` scores a spec's readiness for mechanical codegen across five dimensions — data schema typing, test vector coverage, error catalogue completeness, observability declaration, invariant enforcement points. Output is a numerical score (target ≥90% for high-confidence codegen) plus an explicit gap list.
- **Optional SSDLC profile**: enabled by setting `.state.json.profile` to `["ssdlc"]`. Activates three additional artifact requirements: `threat-model.md` (STRIDE anchored on C4 components), `data-classification.md` (PII flow traced to Sequence diagram messages), `compliance-map.md` (bidirectional Requirement ↔ external-control mapping for SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / GDPR / HIPAA / PCI-DSS).
- **Prompt + script architecture**: all state lives in repo files, all operations are stateless transforms. The skill is deliberately not promoted to an MCP server because there is no in-memory state to share across agents and no cross-session coordination need. Scripts live in `~/projects/skills/plan-builder/scripts/`; shared libraries in `scripts/lib/`.
- **Deprecation contract**: the legacy `planner` skill remains loaded with a deprecation banner for backward compatibility. Any legacy `plans/<slug>/` package remains usable until it is touched by plan-builder, at which point it is peacefully migrated. There is no bulk migration pass; migration is strictly on-touch.
- **Dog-food reference**: the plan that produced this skill — `specs/_archive/plan-builder/` — was itself migrated from `plans/plan-builder/` by the freshly-built `plan-migrate.ts`, making it the first real migration test vector.
- **Future HLS layer (planned, not yet implemented)**: a separate skill (likely `hls-synthesizer`) will sit between plan-builder's `designed` state and `beta-workflow`'s build execution. It will produce pseudo-code artifacts (signature, pre/post conditions, step sequence, exception paths) that bridge the gap between architecture diagrams and target-language code. Will be added via plan-builder's own `extend` mode, serving as the first production demonstration of that mode.

## Tool Surface Runtime

- Beta worktree execution currently assumes dependency parity with the main worktree. In practice, focused test execution may require a local `node_modules` symlink or equivalent environment preparation inside the beta worktree before build-slice verification can run.
- Current runtime already behaves as **per-round tool resolve/inject**, not in-flight tool hot swap.
- `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt.ts` resolves tools inside the run loop before each `processor.process(...)` call.
- `packages/opencode/src/session/resolve-tools.ts` is the aggregation boundary for registry tools, MCP tools, managed-app tools, and session/agent/model-aware permission filtering.
- `packages/opencode/src/mcp/index.ts` maintains a dirty-capable tools cache and emits `mcp.tools.changed`, but the new capability surface becomes effective on the next tools resolution cycle rather than through same-round mutation.
- Autonomous continuation pumping is now **workflow-policy gated**, not always-on: `packages/opencode/src/session/workflow-runner.ts` stops with `not_armed` when `session.workflow.autonomous.enabled !== true`, and `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt.ts` no longer force-enables autorun on ordinary turns.
- Subagent completion resume is **collection-gated, not workflow-gated**: `packages/opencode/src/bus/subscribers/pending-notice-appender.ts` appends the pending notice and enqueues a critical `task_completion` / `task_failure` resume so the main agent always gets a turn to drain completed delegated work, then immediately asks `resumePendingContinuations` to resume that parent session instead of waiting for the next 5s supervisor heartbeat. `packages/opencode/src/session/workflow-runner.ts` lets these completion resumes bypass autorun disabled / workflow completed / blocked / waiting-user stop gates; only technical hard gates such as busy, retry, in-flight, kill-switch, and active supervisor lease can delay collection. After the result is collected into the system prompt, the AI decides in that turn whether to continue or stop.
- The `packages/opencode/src/server/routes/session.ts` `/session/:sessionID/autonomous` route is the explicit runtime switch for this policy surface: it respects `body.enabled`, clears queued continuations when disabling, and only enqueues synthetic continuation messages when autorun is enabled.
- Privileged self-update is a dedicated gateway-daemon path, not general shell privilege escalation. `packages/opencode/src/server/self-update.ts` probes `sudo -n -v` and only executes fixed argv actions for installing `/etc/opencode/webctl.sh`, installing `/usr/local/bin/opencode-gateway`, syncing `/usr/local/share/opencode/frontend`, and restarting `opencode-gateway.service`; every action is audited to `~/.local/state/opencode/self-update-audit.jsonl`. In `packages/opencode/src/server/routes/global.ts`, `/global/web/restart` with `targets:["gateway"]` uses this path in gateway-daemon mode: compile gateway from the resolved repo source, install fixed artifacts via non-interactive sudo, return the accepted response, then schedule the service restart. Non-sudoer daemons fail fast instead of attempting best-effort fallback.
- **Verbal arm / disarm** (specs/_archive/autonomous-opt-in/ Phase 4-6, 2026-04-23): `packages/opencode/src/session/autorun/detector.ts` scans each ingested user message for configured trigger / disarm phrases (loaded from `/etc/opencode/tweaks.cfg` keys `autorun_trigger_phrases` / `autorun_disarm_phrases`, pipe-separated). A match flips `workflow.autonomous.enabled` via `Session.updateAutonomous`. `packages/opencode/src/session/autorun/observer.ts` subscribes to `KillSwitchChanged` and sweeps every armed root session to disarmed on activation. `packages/opencode/src/session/autorun/refill.ts` materializes the next phase of a session's active `specs/<slug>/tasks.md` (state=implementing, discovered under `Instance.directory/specs/*`) when an armed session drains its todolist; if no refill candidate, the session disarms with `stopReason: plan_drained`. The UI toggle removed in 2026-03-21 is not reintroduced — verbal trigger is the sole user-driven arm path.
- Autonomous continuation no longer depends on `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt/runner.txt` or a completion-verify prompt contract. Armed sessions now enqueue only a minimal resume signal, and `packages/opencode/src/session/workflow-runner.ts` stops immediately when no actionable todo exists instead of hardcoding an "update the todolist" prompt.
- `packages/mcp/system-manager/src/index.ts` session/dialog tools are DB-backed through the daemon session API boundary: session metadata/search/subagent listing/export/handover use `/api/v2/session` and `/api/v2/session/:id`, while dialog reads use `/api/v2/session/:id/message`. These routes resolve through `Session.listGlobal` / `Session.get` / `Session.messages` and the `MessageV2` `StorageRouter`, so the MCP tool does not read `storage/session/<sid>/info.json` or legacy message directories as a fallback. Undo/redo-style session mutations use `/session/:id/revert` and `/session/:id/unrevert` rather than editing session metadata files directly.

### Tool Self-Bounding (Layer 2 of context-management subsystem, 2026-04-29)

Variable-size tools cap their own output to a per-invocation token budget before returning, so that no single tool result can dominate the AI's context window. Spec: `specs/_archive/tool-output-chunking/` Phase 1 (DD-2, R-1, INV-8). Lives behind a small contract:

- **`packages/plugin/src/tool.ts`** and **`packages/opencode/src/tool/tool.ts`** add an optional `outputBudget?: number` field to both the plugin-facing `ToolContext` and the internal `Tool.Context`. Optional preserves back-compat with older plugins; runtime tools rely on the helper rather than the field directly.
- **`packages/opencode/src/tool/budget.ts`** is the canonical `ToolBudget` namespace. `ToolBudget.resolve(ctx, toolId)` returns a guaranteed `{tokens, source}` pair (`source` ∈ `ctx | tweaks-default | tweaks-task-override | tweaks-bash-override`). Token estimation is a deterministic `ceil(length/4)` to keep the slice loop fast and provider-agnostic.
- **Five `tweaks.cfg` knobs** added in `packages/opencode/src/config/tweaks.ts`: `tool_output_budget_absolute_cap=50000`, `_context_ratio=0.30`, `_minimum_floor=8000`, `_task_override=60000`, `_bash_override=40000`. Sync accessor `Tweaks.toolOutputBudgetSync()` is the canonical one (tool execute is a hot path).
- **Bounded tools (Phase 1.5–1.12)**: `read.ts`, `glob.ts`, `grep.ts`, `bash.ts`, `webfetch.ts`, `apply_patch.ts`, `task.ts` (subagent `<child_session_output>` block), and the MCP `read_subsession` tool in `packages/mcp/system-manager/src/index.ts`. Each does the same post-hoc token check on the assembled output:
  - Natural fit (≤ budget): return byte-identical to pre-Layer-2 behaviour (**INV-8** — codex prefix cache compatibility).
  - Over budget: shrink the slice in 15% steps until it fits, append a tool-natural hint with the next-slice arg (`offset=N` for read; narrower pattern for glob/grep; `Range` header for webfetch; `sinceMessageID` for read_subsession; `system-manager_read_subsession msgIdx_from` for task).
- **Cross-package wiring**: the MCP `read_subsession` tool inlines the budget logic (chars/4 estimator + 50K-token default) because the system-manager MCP package cannot import from `packages/opencode/`. This duplicates a small constant; cross-package shared util can be considered later if more MCP tools need the same.
- **Existing `Truncate.output` post-hoc layer** in `packages/opencode/src/tool/truncation.ts` remains as the line/byte-based safety net wrapping every tool result via `tool/tool.ts:76`. The Layer 2 token check is the model-aware overlay; the existing line/byte caps are still the first gate for most tools (they tend to fire earlier in practice).
- **Out of scope for Phase 1**: per-tool plumbing of `ctx.outputBudget` from the runtime (model.contextWindow → ratio computation) is deferred. Until that lands, `ToolBudget.resolve` falls back to `tweaks.toolOutputBudgetSync().absoluteCap` per tool, which gives the safe upper-bound default. Tools written today against `ToolBudget.resolve` will pick up the model-aware budget transparently when it's wired.

Layers 1 (hybrid-llm compaction), 3 (context visibility), 4 (`compact_now` tool), and 5 (pin/drop/recall override) ship in subsequent phases of the same spec.

## Builder-Native Beta Workflow Surfaces

- `packages/opencode/src/session/beta-bootstrap.ts` is the builder-native integration layer for beta bootstrap, validation syncback, routine git execution, drift remediation, and finalize behavior.
- It reuses deterministic git/worktree/runtime primitives from `packages/mcp/branch-cicd/src/project-policy.ts` and project-context resolution from `packages/mcp/branch-cicd/src/context.ts` rather than duplicating branch-cicd logic inside the builder runtime.
- Beta context is resolved and persisted at admission time for plans that opt into the beta workflow; planning itself is performed via the `plan-builder` skill, not via runtime tools.
- `packages/opencode/src/session/workflow-runner.ts` owns validation-stage behavior during autonomous build execution: it prepares syncback metadata for testing continuations and, when runtime policy is non-manual, performs builder-owned syncback checkout plus runtime command execution before the validation slice continues.
- The workflow-runner still injects a beta-oriented execution contract for beta-enabled missions, but that text is advisory only after admission succeeds; enforcement now lives in the runtime admission gate plus continuation checks, not in prompt prose.
- The same workflow-runner owns finalize-stage behavior during autonomous build execution: it prepares merge target / branch / cleanup-default metadata for finalize-oriented continuations, surfaces branch-drift remediation preflight when the base branch advanced, and preserves explicit approval gates before destructive actions.
- `checktest` is a distinct workflow state, not a shortcut: when mission policy or user instruction requires fetch-back into a `test/*` branch/worktree for human verification, that fetch-back step must complete and stop for human validation before any later merge to `baseBranch` is attempted.
- Operator-facing `checktest` must preserve direct checkout ergonomics on the authoritative repo: the fetched-back `test/*` branch should remain directly checkout-able from `mainWorktree`, rather than being implicitly occupied by a separate test worktree unless the operator explicitly asked for that shape.
- Builder routine git defaults are now builder-native across local and remote steps: checkout/commit/pull/push automation can run from approved mission/delegation metadata, but push still remains approval-gated where policy requires it and remote operations fail fast when origin/upstream state is not explicit.
- Builder design treats branch drift as a first-class runtime state: when the stored base/main branch has advanced after beta bootstrap, the runtime prepares remediation/rebase preflight and stops for approval; once explicit destructive-gate remediation approval is present, builder-native remediation executes in the beta worktree and still returns control to finalize as a separate step.
- Manual runtime policy remains an explicit operator boundary: builder may prepare syncback metadata, but it must not invent or auto-run runtime commands.
- Destructive finalize execution now has a builder-native execute path, but it is still explicit-approval-only and cleanup remains conservative by default.
- Drift remediation execute is implemented only for explicit approval-confirmed rebase flow and fails fast on dirty beta state or rebase conflicts; no silent history rewrite or implicit conflict recovery is allowed.
- `packages/mcp/branch-cicd/src/beta-tool.ts` and the `beta-workflow` skill remain advisory/migration assets only: they may help operators or continuations understand the beta surface, but they are not build-admission authorities and must not be treated as enforcement boundaries.

## Account Management (3-Tier Architecture)

- **Tier 1 (Storage)**: `packages/opencode/src/account/index.ts`. A pure repository interacting with `accounts.json`. Enforces unique IDs strictly (throws on collision).
- **Tier 2 (Unified Identity Service)**: `packages/opencode/src/auth/index.ts`. The central gateway for deduplicating identities (OAuth/API), resolving collisions, generating unique IDs, and orchestrating async background disposal (`Provider.dispose()`).
- **Tier 3 (Presentation)**: CLI (`accounts.tsx`), Admin TUI (`dialog-admin.tsx`), Webapp (`packages/app/src/components/settings-accounts.tsx`). Thin clients that _must_ route all account additions/deletions through Tier 2.

## Gateway Google Login Binding Boundary

- The per-user daemon gateway remains Linux-PAM-first: Linux authentication continues to resolve the target uid and daemon authority.
- Google login may exist only as a compatibility path when a Google identity is already bound to a Linux user.
- Shared Google OAuth token storage (`~/.config/opencode/gauth.json`) is for managed app token persistence (e.g. Gmail / Calendar) and is not the binding authority for Linux↔Google identity routing.
- Unbound Google identities must fail fast at the gateway; no silent fallback, auto-match, or first-available-user rescue is allowed.
- The gateway exposes a Google compatibility login endpoint at `POST /auth/login/google` that accepts `google_email` and resolves it through the binding registry.
- Binding data, if added, must be separable from shared token storage and queryable by the gateway as an explicit lookup contract.
- The binding registry is modeled as a global module deployed under `/etc/opencode/` (default path `/etc/opencode/google-bindings.json` with optional `OPENCODE_GOOGLE_BINDINGS_PATH` override); it is distinct from user-scoped OAuth token storage and is the gateway's authoritative lookup surface for Linux↔Google identity routing.

## Compaction Subsystem

The compaction subsystem reduces a session's effective message-stream
size before the next LLM call. After the 2026-04-27 redesign + Phase
13 single-source-of-truth consolidation (2026-04-28) the public
surface collapses to **3 concepts, all derived from one source**:

**Single source of truth: the messages stream.** Every compaction
artefact is either written into the stream (anchors) or derived from
it at read time. There are no separate persistence files for journal,
rebind-checkpoint, or shared-context snapshot.

- **Memory** (`packages/opencode/src/session/memory.ts`): a render-time
  view of the messages stream. `Memory.read(sid)` walks finished
  assistant messages and assembles a `SessionMemory` shape (rolled-up
  prior anchor + post-anchor turn summaries). Auxiliary fields
  (`fileIndex`, `actionLog`) come from `SharedContext.Space` (a
  separate file/action workspace). Two render functions:
  `renderForLLMSync(mem, maxTokens?)` for next-LLM-call compact text
  with newest-first cap, and `renderForHumanSync(mem)` for UI preview.
  No file IO.
- **Anchor**: assistant message with `summary: true`. Written by
  `compactWithSharedContext` (or `tryLlmAgent` inline). Lives in the
  message stream as a regular member; `filterCompacted` truncates
  history at the most recent one. Restart / rebind / account-rotation
  all recover by scanning the stream for the most recent anchor and
  slicing forward — `applyStreamAnchorRebind` in `prompt.ts`.
- **Cooldown**: `SessionCompaction.Cooldown.shouldThrottle(sid)` reads
  the most recent anchor message's `time.created`. 30-second window.
  Single rule across within-runloop and cross-runloop boundaries — no
  round counter, no separate persistence.

### Single entry point

```ts
SessionCompaction.run({
  sessionID, observed, step, intent?, abort?
}): Promise<"continue" | "stop">
```

Triggers (`observed`) are observable conditions, not signals: the
runloop's `deriveObservedCondition` reads pinned identity vs most
recent Anchor identity, `session.execution.continuationInvalidatedAt`
timestamp (DD-11), token budget (estimated from current `msgs`, not
stale `lastFinished.tokens`), and message-stream tail. No flags persist
across iterations (DD-1).

### Cost-monotonic kind chain

```
trigger=overflow / cache-aware:
  narrative → replay-tail → low-cost-server → llm-agent

trigger=idle / rebind / continuation-invalidated:
  narrative → replay-tail  (no paid kinds; maintenance only)

trigger=provider-switched:
  narrative → replay-tail  (local fallback only; no paid kinds)

trigger=manual:
  narrative → low-cost-server → llm-agent

trigger=manual + intent=rich:
  llm-agent only
```

`schema` kind (legacy `SharedContext.snapshot` regex extractor) was
retired in Phase 13 — fresh sessions are supposed to be empty, not
back-filled from regex extracts. Local kinds self-cap at
`compaction.targetPromptTokens` (default 50K); if a local kind had to
truncate AND a paid kind remains in the chain, run() escalates
("double-phase" — see DD-13 in compaction-redesign spec).

`INJECT_CONTINUE` table is frozen: rebind / continuation-invalidated /
provider-switched / manual all map to `false`. The 2026-04-27 infinite
loop bug is structurally extinct.

Phase A edge cleanup (2026-05-01, specs/_archive/compaction-improvements):
provider-switched compaction now exposes `SessionCompaction.kindChainFor`
for tests and uses `narrative → replay-tail`, preserving the no-paid-kind
rule while avoiding silent narrative-only failure. The prompt runloop
refreshes `lastFinished.tokens.input` after stream-anchor rebind attempts
for applied, no-anchor, and unsafe-boundary outcomes so downstream
predicate checks do not read stale provider usage. If a runloop iteration
has no user-message boundary (observed in compaction child failure modes),
it logs the boundary state and stops before spawning another model round
instead of throwing `No user message found in stream`.

Phase B context-budget surfacing (2026-05-01,
specs/_archive/compaction-improvements): prompt assembly appends a cache-safe
`<context_budget>` text envelope to the latest user message passed to the
model. The envelope uses only the most recent non-empty server-confirmed
assistant usage snapshot (`tokens.input`, `cache.read`) and labels status
via `Tweaks.compactionSync().budgetStatusThresholds` (default
`0.50,0.75,0.90`). It is not added to the stable system prompt. Runtime
self-heal nudges carry the same envelope, and subagent sessions inherit the
same assembly path for their own session-local budget.

Phase C trigger inventory and codex routing (2026-05-01,
specs/_archive/compaction-improvements): `deriveObservedCondition` is now backed by
an explicit `TRIGGER_INVENTORY` precedence contract including
`stall-recovery` and `predicted-cache-miss`. Stall recovery compacts after
consecutive empty high-context assistant rounds without injecting a
synthetic Continue. Predicted cache miss maps to `cache-aware` only when the
cache-loss signal is explicit and uncached input exceeds tweak thresholds.
`SessionCompaction.resolveKindChain` makes kind ordering provider-aware:
high-context codex OAuth subscription sessions (detected from the codex
cost-zero model surface) prioritize `low-cost-server` before local narrative
for overflow/cache-aware/manual triggers, while non-codex and non-subscription
models keep the base chain. The codex provider's regular `/responses` request
body is assembled through `buildResponsesApiRequest`, which always emits Mode
1 server compaction shape `context_management: [{ type: "compaction",
compact_threshold }]`; the standalone `/responses/compact` hook remains kind
`low-cost-server`.

Phase D/E big-content boundary and telemetry (2026-05-01,
specs/_archive/compaction-improvements): oversized boundary payloads are routed by
session-scoped reference instead of being injected raw into the next model
context. `MessageV2.AttachmentRefPart` (`type: "attachment_ref"`) is the
message-stream pointer, while raw bytes live behind `SessionStorage.Router`
attachment blob APIs implemented by both LegacyStore and SQLiteStore (SQLite
schema v2 `attachments` table). `user-message-parts.ts` stores oversized
file/data uploads as attachment refs; `tool/task.ts` stores oversized child
session returns in the parent session namespace before emitting pending
subagent notices; `tool/attachment.ts` is the bounded drilldown surface for
text/file digest and task-result references. Missing refs and image/vision
capability gaps fail explicitly; runtime never silently selects another model
or falls back to raw oversized content. `session/compaction-telemetry.ts`
provides raw-content-safe payload builders for predicate outcomes, kind-chain
resolution, context-budget surfacing, and big-content boundary routing;
callers emit these through existing debug checkpoints rather than a parallel
telemetry bus.

### Subagent compaction (DD-12)

Subagents use the same state-driven path as parents for rebind /
continuation-invalidated / provider-switched / overflow / cache-aware.
Compaction writes to the subagent's own message stream (not the
parent's). The only `observed` value subagents do not trigger is
`"manual"` (no UI surface).

### Continuation-invalidated signal (DD-11)

Codex `ContinuationInvalidatedEvent` (when server rejects
`previous_response_id`) is recorded on
`session.execution.continuationInvalidatedAt`. Next runloop iteration
returns `"continuation-invalidated"` from `deriveObservedCondition`
when this timestamp is newer than the most recent Anchor's
`time.created`. State-driven cooldown via anchor-recency comparison —
no flag-clear step.

Hotfix (2026-04-29, Codex WS context overflow): compaction/rebind and
same-provider account switches invalidate the **continuation family**
(`sessionID` plus `sessionID:accountId` shards) rather than only the
base session key. This prevents an old per-account `lastResponseId`
from being restored after local messages have moved to a new anchor
generation. Codex WS context-overflow errors also mark the in-memory
continuation as invalidated before surfacing the provider error, so the
next recovery path does not trust the stale server-side chain.

### Turn summaries (DD-2 — derive-time, not capture-time)

Turn summaries are derived at `Memory.read` time by walking the
messages stream. Each finished assistant message (excluding narration,
anchors, subagent narration) contributes its last text part as a turn
summary. The `captureTurnSummaryOnExit` write path was removed in
Phase 13 — there's nothing to "capture" because the stream already has
the data.

### Single-gate context management (Phase 13 follow-up, 2026-04-28)

Tool-output prune was retired. Earlier design ran a "smart prune" at
80% utilization that marked old tool outputs as `time.compacted` so
`toModelMessages` would substitute them with a stub on the next prompt
assembly. That mechanism was **cache-hostile**: each prune mutated
mid-prompt bytes, breaking the codex prefix cache for every LLM call
in the 80%→90% window — paying full input-token cost on every round
just to delay the (cheap, ~1s) compaction event by ~10% utilization.
Net effect was negative.

The single context-management gate is now `run({observed: "overflow"})`
firing at the configured `overflowThreshold` (default 90%). Narrative
kind writes a fresh anchor; cache rebuilds from the new prefix. Config
fields `compaction.prune` and `compaction.pruneUtilizationFloor` are
deprecated (silently ignored). The `time.compacted` per-part flag and
the `[Old tool result content cleared]` substitution in
`toModelMessages` are kept so legacy sessions with already-marked parts
still display correctly, but no code path produces new marks.

### Two-type overflow taxonomy (POST-PHASE-13)

Phase 13 closes the **cumulative-history overflow** problem: as
history grows, double-phase compaction compresses past turns with
narrative → escalation if needed. A second class of overflow remains
out of scope: **acute single-tool-output overflow** — a single tool
returning text larger than the model's context (e.g.
`system-manager_read_subsession` dumping a whole transcript). No
compaction strategy can save a single chunk that's already too large.
That class will be addressed by a follow-up plan covering tool
self-chunking + chunked-digest protocol (round-aligned slice points,
AI-collaborative digest of each chunk).

### Plan reference

Full design: `specs/_archive/compaction-redesign/` (proposal.md, spec.md,
design.md, c4.json, sequence.json, idef0.json, grafcet.json,
data-schema.json, tasks.md, handoff.md, errors.md, observability.md,
invariants.md). Phase 13 is documented inline in tasks.md as Section 13.
Implementation history in `docs/events/`.

### Hybrid-LLM Compaction (Phase 2 of context-management subsystem, 2026-04-29)

`hybrid_llm` (specs/_archive/tool-output-chunking/, refactor 2026-04-29) is a background enrichment post-step for `overflow / cache-aware / manual` triggers when `compaction_enable_hybrid_llm` is enabled. The foreground chain first commits a fast anchor (`narrative / replay-tail / low-cost-server / llm-agent`, provider-aware as described above); after success, `scheduleHybridEnrichment` may upgrade that anchor asynchronously. Maintenance triggers (`idle / rebind / continuation-invalidated / provider-switched`) are untouched — they don't need a paid LLM call.

- **`SessionCompaction.Hybrid` namespace** (in `packages/opencode/src/session/compaction.ts`): types mirror `specs/_archive/tool-output-chunking/data-schema.json` (`Anchor` / `JournalEntry` / `PinnedZoneEntry` / `ContextMarkers` / `ContextStatus` / `LLMCompactRequest` / `CompactionEvent` / `ErrorCode`). Pure functions for validation + envelope wrapping + payload construction.
- **`Memory.Hybrid` accessors** (in `memory.ts`): selectors over the message stream — `getAnchorMessage` / `getJournalMessages` / `getPinnedToolMessages` / `recallMessage`. INV-10 single-source-of-truth preserved.
- **`runLlmCompact` (single-pass core)**: builds the framing-prompt + user-payload from `LLMCompactRequest`, dispatches the LLM round through `SessionProcessor` (mirroring `runLlmCompactionAgent`), reads back assistant text, runs `validateAnchorBody` against `hybrid-llm-framing.md` §"Output validation". Returns a discriminated `LlmCompactResult`. When the request's input exceeds the model's per-request budget, dispatches to `runLlmCompactChunkAndMerge` (DD-3 internal mode).
- **`runLlmCompactChunkAndMerge` (cold-start path)**: walks journal in chunks sized to fit the LLM's input budget. Each chunk's `LLM_compact` call takes the running digest as `priorAnchor` + that chunk as journal. Final iteration's output is validated and persisted as the actual anchor; intermediates are LLM-only scratch. Triggers on huge legacy sessions opening for the first time.
- **`runHybridLlm` (recovery ladder)**: 1 retry with stricter framing (validation-failure reason as prompt addendum) → if both attempts fail AND `pinned_zone` is non-empty, fires Phase 2 (`framing.strict=true`, target `compaction_phase2_max_anchor_tokens`, absorbs pinned_zone) → if Phase 2 also fails, raises `E_OVERFLOW_UNRECOVERABLE` (bounded chain length = 2; no Phase 3, INV-6) → if pinned_zone is empty and Phase 1 exhausts, falls through to graceful degradation (keep prior anchor; the chain walker tries the next legacy kind). Returns `CompactionEvent` for telemetry. Phase 2.9 follow-up will add the optional fallback-provider step.
- **DD-10 migration**: any `assistant + summary === true` message on disk is accepted as `priorAnchor` for hybrid_llm — legacy narrative-produced anchors work without rewrites.
- **DD-4 pinned envelope** (closes G-1): `wrapPinnedToolMessage` produces a synthesised user-role message preserving `tool_call`/`tool_result` adjacency in journal (INV-4). Production producer is Phase 5 (Layer 5 override surface) — until then, `pinned_zone` stays empty and the actual prompt byte-layout matches today's.
- **Framing prompt** at `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt/hybrid-llm-framing.md` (Phase 2.1 git-mv'd from specs/). Lazy-loaded via `Bun.file()`, cached after first compaction event. Falls back to an inline minimal framing constant if the file is missing.
- **4 tweaks knobs** (`compaction_llm_timeout_ms` / `compaction_fallback_provider` / `compaction_phase2_max_anchor_tokens` / `compaction_pinned_zone_max_tokens_ratio`) configure the recovery ladder + Phase 2 + pinned cap. Sync accessor `Tweaks.compactionSync()` for the hot path.
- **Tests**: 22 pure-function unit tests at `packages/opencode/test/session/compaction-hybrid.test.ts`. Integration tests against a live LLM are deferred to the cross-provider regression harness (Phase 2.18).

Open work tracked in `specs/_archive/tool-output-chunking/tasks.md`: Phase 2.13 explicit 5-zone refactor (deferred to Phase 5 alongside Layer 5 override surface), Phase 2.15 pin cap forcing Phase 2 (deferred — depends on Phase 5 producer), Phase 2.18-2.20 cross-provider + failure-injection + daemon-restart tests (need LLM-stub harness), Phase 2.21 cache hit-rate post-merge gate (requires real-traffic telemetry over time), Phase 2.12 retire legacy kinds (deferred until telemetry shows hybrid_llm carries the load on real sessions for several days). Phase 3 (visibility) / Phase 4 (`compact_now`) / Phase 5 (pin/drop/recall override) are independent slices.

## Key Modules

- **`src/account`**: Disk persistence (`accounts.json`), ID generation, basic CRUD.
- **`src/auth`**: Identity resolution, OAuth token parsing, high-level API key addition, collision avoidance.
- **`src/provider`**: Manages active connections to model providers and their runtime instances.
- **`src/provider/supported-provider-registry.ts`**: Repo-owned canonical supported provider registry; the single source of truth for the cms official provider universe and product labels.
- **`src/provider/canonical-family-source.ts`**: Canonical provider row builder and runtime-provider resolver. Canonical rows are registry-first; accounts, connected providers, disabled state, and models.dev only overlay state onto supported providers.
- **`src/server/routes/provider.ts`**: `/provider` API assembly surface. Returns canonical provider rows keyed by supported provider registry, not raw observed provider IDs.
- **`packages/app/src/components/model-selector-state.ts`**: Web model manager provider-row state builder. Frontend canonical aliases may be used for provider grouping and display, but disabled-provider blacklist matching must keep legacy `anthropic` distinct from canonical `claude-cli` so WebApp provider gating does not misclassify Claude CLI as disabled.

## Runtime State Initialization Safety

- Module-scope eager `Instance.state(...)` initialization is now considered an architecture risk surface.
- Shared runtime modules should prefer lazy/guarded state access so import-time module evaluation does not hard-require a fully populated `Instance` context.
- This rule matters both for runtime resilience and for any execution surface that provides only partial `Instance` context (for example worker/bootstrap/test harness paths).
- When state truly belongs to the current `Instance`, the module should resolve it on demand; when `Instance.state` is unavailable, any fallback must remain explicit, local, and non-authoritative rather than silently changing higher-level runtime contracts.
- `packages/opencode/src/project/instance.ts` and `packages/opencode/src/bus/index.ts` now also treat missing project context defensively: `Instance.project` may fall back to the global sentinel and bus context resolution must not crash on absent project metadata.

## Config Resolution Boundary

- `packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts` remains the authority for repo/user/local config merge behavior.
- Legacy compatibility still includes `autoshare: true` → `share: "auto"`; removing that migration changes persisted user behavior and is therefore a contract change, not a cleanup.
- Config resolution for non-git nested projects must not be prematurely truncated by current-worktree boundaries alone; nested non-git execution surfaces may still inherit parent `opencode.json` / `.opencode` configuration through the documented upward merge path.
- Config/state initialization should follow the same lazy-state safety rule as other runtime modules so config import does not become a hidden bootstrap-time failure surface.

### Split Config Files + Crash Defense (plans/config-restructure)

**Three-file layout** (all optional; missing files → no-op merge):

- `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` — boot-critical keys (`$schema`, `plugin`, `permissionMode`, `username`, `keybinds`, `compaction`, etc.). A parse failure here falls back through the LKG snapshot (see below); if no snapshot exists, `/config` returns HTTP 503 without crashing the daemon.
- `~/.config/opencode/providers.json` — `provider`, `disabled_providers`, `model`. **Section-isolated**: a parse failure only zeroes out the provider section. Other subsystems keep running.
- `~/.config/opencode/mcp.json` — `mcp`. **Section-isolated and lazy**: a parse failure only disables the MCP subsystem; MCP connects are already lazy (first tool call) so the main UI is untouched.

Legacy all-in-one `opencode.json` continues to work unchanged — the split files simply overlay additional merge layers when present.

**Error flow** (`packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts`, `packages/opencode/src/server/app.ts`, `packages/app/src/utils/server-errors.ts`):

- `Config.JsonError` / `Config.InvalidError` / `Config.ConfigDirectoryTypoError` map to HTTP **503** in `onError`. The response body is structured (`{ name, data: { path, line, column, code, problemLine, hint } }`) — **raw config text must never leave the daemon**. Daemon-side `log.error` carries a ±3-line debug snippet for operators.
- Webapp renders `ConfigJsonError` / `ConfigInvalidError` via `formatServerError` with a `truncate()` guard (500-char cap) as a defense in depth for older daemons or unexpected shapes.

**Last-known-good snapshot**:

- Path: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/opencode/config-lkg.json` (defaults to `~/.local/state/opencode/config-lkg.json`).
- Written atomically (`.pid.tmp` + `rename`) on every successful `createState()`; every fallback read emits `log.warn` with the failed path + snapshot age (AGENTS.md rule #1: no silent fallback).
- Served as `{ ...config, configStale: true }` so downstream consumers can surface a "using snapshot" banner when relevant.

**Provider availability derivation** (`packages/opencode/src/provider/availability.ts`):

- `ProviderAvailability.snapshot()` reads `Account.listAll()` + `config.disabled_providers` and yields `{ hasAccount, overrideDisabled, byProvider }` with availability ∈ `"enabled" | "disabled" | "no-account"`.
- Runtime behavior of `isProviderAllowed` is unchanged (still `!disabled.has(id)`) — the existing per-path gates (env / auth / account / plugin) already handle "no-account → hide" correctly, so a central filter would regress env-based providers. Availability is a first-class surface for UI and future Phase 3 `providers.json` override.
- `scripts/migrate-disabled-providers.ts --dry-run|--apply` and `scripts/migrate-config-split.ts --dry-run|--apply` are operator-invoked one-shots (with `.pre-*.bak` backups) for pruning the legacy denylist and splitting the combined config.

## Provider Universe Authority

- The cms official provider universe is defined by the repo-owned supported provider registry, not by observed runtime/config/models/account provider IDs.
- Initial supported provider set is: `openai`, `claude-cli`, `google-api`, `gemini-cli`, `github-copilot`, `gmicloud`, `openrouter`, `vercel`, `gitlab`, `opencode`.
- `models.dev` is an enrichment source only: it may update models and metadata for supported providers, but it must not introduce new product-visible providers by itself.
- Runtime custom providers and config-injected providers may still exist for execution, but unsupported keys must fail closed at the provider-list boundary and must not appear in `/provider` or primary UI provider lists unless explicitly added to the registry.
- Legacy provider aliases are not universally interchangeable. In particular, transport/protocol aliasing such as `anthropic -> claude-cli` must not be reused for WebApp disabled-provider matching or favorites/provider-visibility gates.

### `disabled_providers` runtime scope (plans/provider-hotfix, 2026-04-18)

- `disabled_providers` is an **auto-gate**, not a global kill. A listed provider is hidden from catalog iterators (`Provider.list()`, default-model selector, TUI/CLI provider lists, `/provider` REST surface) but the provider entry STAYS in `state().providers`.
- Explicit lookups via `Provider.getModel(providerId, modelId)` continue to resolve for disabled providers — this is the operator's rescue path when they have accounts or `config.provider.<id>` entries but listed the id in `disabled_providers` (e.g. to suppress default-model churn). Every explicit bypass logs once via `log.info`.
- `Provider.listAllIncludingHidden()` exposes the full set for admin/debug flows that need to show hidden entries.
- This narrowing mirrors the sibling `plans/manual-pin-bypass-preflight/` philosophy: auto-path gates must never block explicit operator intent.

### Codex provider request envelope (plans/provider-hotfix Phase 2, 2026-04-18)

- `/responses` requests carry three context-window lineage headers in addition to `ChatGPT-Account-Id` and `x-codex-turn-state`:
  - `x-codex-window-id` — `conversationId:generation` (stable per session; already present pre-hotfix)
  - `x-codex-parent-thread-id` — `Session.parentID` when the session is a subagent
  - `x-openai-subagent` — agent name for subagent lineage
- `session/llm.ts` sets `x-opencode-parent-session` / `x-opencode-subagent` opencode-side headers; `packages/opencode-codex-provider/src/provider.ts` reads them and feeds `buildHeaders()` in `packages/opencode-codex-provider/src/headers.ts`, which emits the upstream names.

### Codex logout revoke (plans/provider-hotfix Phase 1, 2026-04-18)

- `Account.remove("codex", accountId)` calls `CodexAuth.logoutCodex(refreshToken)` BEFORE deleting the local entry. The helper POSTs to `https://auth.openai.com/oauth/revoke` with `token_type_hint=refresh_token` and is **fail-closed**: a non-2xx response or network error throws, and the local credentials stay in place until the operator retries. This prevents orphaned backend tokens after logout.

### Anthropic effort variants for Opus 4.7+ (plans/provider-hotfix Phase 3, 2026-04-18)

- `packages/opencode/src/provider/transform.ts` Anthropic branch returns the `xhigh` variant (budget `min(32_000, model.limit.output - 1)`) for models whose id matches `claude-opus-4-N` with `N >= 7`, or whose `release_date >= "2026-03-19"`. Mirrors the OpenAI `xhigh` gate pattern.

### Codex family rotation rule (plans/codex-rotation-hotfix, 2026-04-18; superseded in part by specs/_archive/provider-account-decoupling 2026-05-03)

- Codex and openai share the ChatGPT subscription `wham/usage` endpoint. `RateLimitJudge.getBackoffStrategy` returns `"cockpit"` for both families; `fetchCockpitBackoff` treats them identically via the `COCKPIT_WHAM_USAGE_FAMILIES` set. The pure helper `evaluateWhamUsageQuota` drives per-candidate `isQuotaLimited` inside `rotation3d.buildFallbackCandidates`, so a codex account that drained its 5H or weekly window is skipped instead of blindly retried.
- ~~`rotation3d.enforceCodexFamilyOnly`~~ **deleted 2026-05-03 by `specs/_archive/provider-account-decoupling/` DD-5.** Rotation comparisons are now pure equality on family-form `providerId`. Same-family containment is enforced structurally (registry only holds family entries; per-account state lives under `providers[family].accounts[accountId]`), not by a string-shape gate. Codex follows the same rotation policy as every other family.
- When `findFallback` returns null and the current vector is codex, `session/llm.ts::handleRateLimitFallback` throws `CodexFamilyExhausted` (NamedError defined in `rate-limit-judge.ts`). `session/processor.ts` wraps each in-catch-block `handleRateLimitFallback` call with a local try/catch that surfaces the error via `MessageV2.fromError` and sets session state to idle; the preflight call in the outer try block bubbles the throw into the existing catch-fallthrough path.
- `account/rotation/backoff.ts::parseRateLimitReason` adds passive message-pattern guards for codex 5H / response-time-window / weekly-usage strings as a belt-and-suspenders when cockpit is unreachable, mapping them to `QUOTA_EXHAUSTED`.

### Provider / Family / Account Naming (specs/_archive/provider-account-decoupling, 2026-05-03)

Three orthogonal dimensions are addressed throughout the dispatch chain:

- **Family** (`providerId`) — canonical, stable, in `Account.knownFamilies()`. Examples: `codex`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini-cli`. Regex: `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`. **The ONLY shape that may appear as a key in the providers registry.**
- **AccountId** — opaque per-account identifier. Today happens to be `<family>-(api|subscription)-<slug>`, but treat as opaque outside `Account.generateId`. **MUST NEVER appear as `providerId` outside accounts.json storage keys** — this is the regression that caused the 2026-05-02 `CodexFamilyExhausted` mis-fire.
- **ModelId** — model name, e.g. `gpt-5.5`, `claude-opus-4-7`.

Boundary enforcement:

- `provider/registry-shape.ts:assertFamilyKey(providerId, knownFamilies)` is called at every `providers[X] = ...` write site in `provider.ts`. Throws `RegistryShapeError` on miss — no resolution attempt, no silent fallback.
- `Auth.get(family, accountId?)` — two-arg only. Single-arg form removed. Throws `UnknownFamilyError` on bad family, `NoActiveAccountError` when accountId omitted and the family has no `activeAccount` set.
- `Provider.getSDK(family, accountId, modelId)` — three-arg only. Caller carries `ModelDispatch { family, accountId, modelId }` from the session processor through the dispatch path.
- `Account.parseProvider` and `Account.resolveFamilyFromKnown` are tagged `@internal:migration-only` — kept ONLY so the one-shot migration script can normalise legacy storage fields. Runtime dispatch paths must not call them; new callers re-introduce the bug class.

One-shot storage migration:

- `packages/opencode/scripts/migrate-provider-account-decoupling.ts` rewrites legacy per-account `providerId` strings on disk (`storage/message/<sid>/<mid>.json` top-level `providerId` and `model.providerId`; `storage/session/<sid>/info.json` `execution.providerId`) to canonical family form.
- Subcommands: `--dry-run` (default, safe to re-run), `--apply` (backup → rewrite → marker), `--verify` (read-only consistency check).
- Backup: `<storage>/.backup/provider-account-decoupling-<ISO>/` (full `accounts.json` + `storage/{session,message}` snapshot).
- Marker: `<storage>/.migration-state.json` with `{ version: "1", migrated_at, backup_path }`.
- Daemon boot guard (`server/migration-boot-guard.ts`, called from `cli/cmd/serve.ts`) refuses to start if the marker is missing or carries a non-`"1"` version, exiting 1 with a remediation hint per AGENTS.md rule 1.

## Managed App Registry (MCP Apps)

### Overview

The Managed App Registry (`packages/opencode/src/mcp/app-registry.ts`) provides a lifecycle state machine for built-in MCP apps that run under opencode runtime ownership. Apps are registered in `BUILTIN_CATALOG` and exposed as AI-callable tools through the MCP tool router.

### State Machine

```
available → installed → pending_config → pending_auth → ready
                     → disabled
                     → error
```

### Registered Apps

| App ID            | Name            | Scope                             | Tools                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `google-calendar` | Google Calendar | `calendar`, `calendar.events`     | 7 (list-calendars, list-events, get-event, create-event, update-event, delete-event, freebusy)                                                      |
| `gmail`           | Gmail           | `https://mail.google.com/` (full) | 10 (list-labels, list-messages, get-message, send-message, reply-message, forward-message, modify-labels, trash-message, list-drafts, create-draft) |

### Shared Google OAuth

Both Google apps share a single OAuth token stored at `~/.config/opencode/gauth.json`. The OAuth connect flow (`/api/v2/mcp/apps/:appId/oauth/connect`) merges scopes from all installed Google apps before redirecting to Google's consent screen. After successful callback, all installed Google apps are marked configured and enabled.

- Shared Google token freshness is maintained by the MCP runtime, which must perform a silent daemon-start background sweep for the Google app surface only when at least one Google managed app is actually installed and enabled, and keep refresh work serialized so background and on-demand refresh do not race each other.
- Google managed-app observability remains derived from the shared token file, but refresh success must publish updates only for the active Google app set so observers re-read current state without receiving synthetic updates for inactive apps.

### Key Files

- `packages/opencode/src/mcp/app-registry.ts` — BUILTIN_CATALOG, state machine, persistence (`managed-apps.json`)
- `packages/opencode/src/mcp/index.ts` — Tool conversion (`convertManagedAppTool`), executor routing (`managedAppExecutors`)
- `packages/opencode/src/mcp/index.ts` — MCP lifecycle/init surface; hosts the daemon-start sweep entrypoint for shared Google token refresh orchestration.
- `packages/opencode/src/mcp/apps/google-calendar/` — Calendar client + executors
- `packages/opencode/src/mcp/apps/gmail/` — Gmail client + executors
- `packages/opencode/src/server/routes/mcp.ts` — OAuth connect/callback routes, app lifecycle API
- `~/.config/opencode/gauth.json` — Shared Google OAuth token storage
- `~/.config/opencode/managed-apps.json` — App install/config state persistence

## Account Bus Events

- **Event Types**: `account.added`, `account.removed`, `account.activated` — defined in `src/bus/index.ts`.
- **Sanitization**: `sanitizeInfo()` strips secrets (apiKey, refreshToken) before inclusion in bus event payloads.
- **Mutation Mutex**: All account mutations (`add`, `remove`, `setActive`, `update`) are serialized via an in-process Promise-chain mutex (`withMutex`) in `src/account/index.ts`, preventing concurrent race conditions on `accounts.json`.

## Data Flow (Account Deletion)

1. **User Request**: Triggered from TUI/Webapp.
2. **Optimistic UI**: Component removes account from local state immediately.
3. **Service Layer**: `Auth.remove()` calls `Account.remove()` (sync disk deletion).
4. **Background Cleanup**: `Auth.remove()` initiates a non-blocking promise to call `Provider.dispose()` and final disk save.
5. **Bus Event**: `Account.remove()` publishes `account.removed` via GlobalBus → SSE → all connected clients.

## Workspace Change Surfaces

- **Session-owned diff**: `GET /session/:sessionID/diff` returns the authoritative session-owned dirty diff for the current workspace. It is computed from session-owned candidate files intersected with current git-uncommitted state.
- **Workspace git status**: `GET /file/status` returns the whole workdir/project git status for the resolved directory.
- **UI boundary**:
  - Web/TUI session review flows may consume `session.diff` when the UX is explicitly about session-owned changes.
  - TUI sidebar `Changes` and webapp changes sidebar use workspace-level git status (`file.status`) when the UX is explicitly about current workdir uncommitted files.
- These two sources must not be silently conflated; session attribution and workdir cleanliness are separate contracts.

## beta-tool MCP Architecture

- `packages/mcp/branch-cicd` adds a standalone stdio MCP server published as capability `beta-tool`.
- Public tools are exactly `newbeta`, `syncback`, and `merge`.
- The package resolves project context before mutating git state: canonical repo root, authoritative base branch, deterministic beta worktree root, and runtime policy.
- The package is project-aware rather than `cms`-hard-coded: this repo resolves a `webctl.sh` runtime adapter, while non-matching repos must provide explicit runtime policy or complete a bounded clarification step.
- Ambiguity and destructive confirmation are surfaced as structured orchestrator-question contracts rather than silent fallback: repo root, branch name, runtime policy, merge target, and merge confirmation all stop until explicit selection is supplied.
- Loop metadata is persisted under XDG state so repeated beta edit → syncback → runtime validation cycles can reuse the same branch/worktree mapping across sessions.
- `merge` remains approval-gated and re-checks dirty state before merge, worktree removal, or branch deletion.

## Session Monitor / Telemetry Architecture

### Current State

- Runtime emits telemetry-related events from session processing, and supported telemetry events are persisted by `packages/opencode/src/bus/subscribers/telemetry-runtime.ts` into `RuntimeEventService`.
- `packages/opencode/src/session/monitor.ts` currently constructs telemetry-bearing monitor rows, and `GET /session/top` returns those rows as snapshots.
- App currently refreshes `session.top` through `packages/app/src/pages/session/use-status-monitor.ts` and hydrates `session_telemetry` through `packages/app/src/context/sync.tsx` plus `packages/app/src/pages/session/monitor-helper.ts`.
- This means current steady-state behavior is still influenced by hydration-first / monitor-first / page-hook-first paths.

### Target State

- Telemetry is bus-messaging-first / DDS-aligned.
- Runtime emits telemetry events as source facts.
- A server-side telemetry projector owns the authoritative telemetry read model.
- App global-sync reducer owns the canonical telemetry slice.
- UI surfaces are pure consumers of reducer-owned telemetry state.
- `session.top` is bootstrap / catch-up / degraded snapshot transport only.

### Builder Execution Path

1. Freeze current-state baseline and label every wrong authority path.
2. Define the runtime telemetry event contract before downstream design.
3. Define projector aggregate ownership and projector read-model boundaries.
4. Cut steady-state app ownership over to the reducer-owned `session_telemetry` slice.
5. Demote `session.top` and all snapshot/hydration/page-hook paths to bootstrap/recovery-only behavior.
6. Remove conflicting legacy glue and validate that no duplicate authority remains.

### Ownership Rules

- Runtime owns telemetry fact emission, not app hydration.
- Server projector is the only telemetry read-model authority.
- Monitor rows and snapshot routes are downstream projector consumers, not telemetry authorities.
- App page hooks, hydration helpers, and local fallback must not hold steady-state telemetry authority.
- UI components may render telemetry but must not synthesize or persist telemetry truth.

### Minimum Authority Shapes

- Runtime event contract must at minimum distinguish prompt telemetry, round telemetry, compaction telemetry, and session-summary-relevant facts.
- Projector aggregate must at minimum distinguish prompt summary, round summary, compaction summary, session cumulative summary, freshness metadata, and degraded/catch-up metadata.
- App reducer slice must remain session-scoped and canonical, with enough structure for UI consumption but without reintroducing helper-side truth synthesis.

### Context Sidebar Card Surface

- `packages/app/src/components/session/session-context-tab.tsx` is the context-sidebar composition surface for session context metrics plus telemetry cards.
- Legacy context information is grouped into three cards: `Summary`, `Breakdown`, and `Prompt`.
- Context sidebar card order is persisted in app layout state via `packages/app/src/context/layout.tsx` under `contextSidebar.order`.
- The sortable interaction pattern intentionally follows the same UI family as the status sidebar card ordering, but remains a separate persisted order key.
- This is a presentation-layer layout contract only; it does not change telemetry authority boundaries or backend data ownership.

### Migration Warnings

- Hydration-first steady-state is architecturally wrong and must be removed or demoted.
- Monitor-first steady-state is architecturally wrong and must be removed or demoted.
- Page-hook-first steady-state is architecturally wrong and must be removed or demoted.
- Any implementation that leaves `session.top`, monitor hydration, or local fallback as a steady-state telemetry writer is architecture drift.
- Partial migration that introduces projector/reducer while preserving legacy steady-state writers is invalid.

## Daemon Architecture (Multi-User Web Runtime)

### Overview

The web runtime supports a multi-user deployment model with process-level isolation:

```
Internet → [C Gateway :1080] → Unix Socket → [Per-User Daemon (uid=user)]
                                             → [Per-User Daemon (uid=user2)]
```

### Components

#### C Root Gateway (`daemon/opencode-gateway.c`)

- Runs as root, listens on TCP port (default :1080)
- **Non-blocking Event Loop**: Single-threaded `epoll_wait` loop; no blocking I/O in main loop. All sockets set `O_NONBLOCK` at accept time
- **Tagged epoll Context** (`EpollCtx`): Discriminated union (`ECTX_LISTEN | ECTX_PENDING | ECTX_SPLICE_CLIENT | ECTX_SPLICE_DAEMON | ECTX_AUTH_NOTIFY`) attached to each epoll fd so events dispatch by type and direction
- **HTTP Request Accumulation** (`PendingRequest`): Per-connection 8KB read buffer. TCP segments accumulated via EPOLLIN until `\r\n\r\n` detected, timeout (30s), or oversize (400/408). No assumption of single-recv completeness
- **Thread-per-auth PAM**: Login requests spawn `pthread` for `pam_authenticate`; result notified to main loop via `eventfd`. Main loop never blocked by PAM
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP hash table (mod 256), sliding window 5 failures / 60s → 429. Successful login clears counter
- **JWT Sessions**: HMAC-SHA256 with **file-backed persistent secret** (`/run/opencode-gateway/jwt.key`, configurable via `OPENCODE_JWT_KEY_PATH`). Validates `sub` + `exp` claims; `sub` → `getpwnam()` → uid
- **Per-User Daemon Spawning**: `fork() → initgroups() → setgid() → setuid() → execvp()` with pre-parsed argv array (no `sh -c` after setuid)
- **splice() Proxy**: Zero-copy bidirectional forwarding (TCP ↔ pipe ↔ Unix socket). Directional: each epoll event splices one direction only based on `EpollCtx.type`
- **Connection Lifecycle**: `EPOLL_CTL_DEL` before `close()` on all fds; `closed` flag guards against in-flight epoll events on same connection; `g_nconns` counter tracks active splice connections
- **Runtime Path Detection** (WSL2-safe): `resolve_runtime_dir()` probes `/run/user/<uid>` → `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` → `/tmp/opencode-<uid>/` (mkdir 700) with logging at each fallback
- **PAM Availability Probe**: Startup-time `pam_start("login", ...)` check; fails fast with guidance if PAM is unconfigured
- **Registry**: In-memory UID → (pid, socket_path, state) mapping; SIGCHLD handler cleans up crashed daemons
- **Login Page**: Serves static HTML login form for unauthenticated requests

#### Per-User Daemon (`opencode serve --unix-socket`)

- Runs as the authenticated user's UID
- Listens on Unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/opencode/daemon.sock`
- Full opencode server (API + SSE + WebSocket) available over Unix socket
- **Discovery File**: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/opencode/daemon.json` — contains `{ socketPath, pid, startedAt, version }`
- **PID File**: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/opencode/daemon.pid` — single-instance guard
- **Cleanup**: Removes discovery + PID files on SIGTERM/SIGINT/process exit; stale files detected and cleaned by `readDiscovery()`
- **Idle Timeout**: 120s TCP/Unix socket idle timeout via `Bun.serve({ idleTimeout: 120 })`

#### TUI Attach Mode (`opencode --attach`)

- Connects to an already-running per-user daemon via Unix socket
- **Auto-Spawn**: If no daemon is discovered, `Daemon.spawn()` launches a detached `opencode serve --unix-socket` child process, polls for `daemon.json` readiness (timeout 10s), then attaches
- **Discovery**: Reads `daemon.json`, validates PID alive (`kill -0`)
- **Custom Fetch**: `createUnixFetch(socketPath)` — routes HTTP requests over Unix socket
- **Custom SSE**: `createUnixEventSource(socketPath, baseUrl)` — streaming SSE client with manual line parsing over Unix socket fetch
- **Graceful Disconnect**: Ctrl+C closes SSE (AbortController) without affecting daemon

#### Daemon Coordination (Discovery-First)

- **Discovery file is truth, in-memory registry is cache**: Both TUI and C gateway use `daemon.json` as the canonical coordination point
- **TUI auto-spawn**: `--attach` → no daemon → `Daemon.spawn()` → daemon writes `daemon.json` → TUI attaches; this is the explicit attach contract and replaces prior fail-fast drift in older docs
- **Gateway adopt**: On web login, C gateway checks `daemon.json` (path resolved via `resolve_runtime_dir()`) before spawning a new daemon. If PID alive and socket connect succeeds → adopt into registry → splice proxy. Stale discovery/socket state is explicitly cleaned instead of silently reused. Covers daemons pre-spawned by TUI `--attach`
- **Gateway JWT validation**: Gateway base64url-decodes payload, validates `sub` + `exp` claims, derives uid via `getpwnam(sub)`, routes by verified identity. JWT secret is file-backed and survives gateway restarts
- **Race safety**: `daemon.pid` acts as single-instance guard; whoever creates the daemon first wins, latecomers discover and adopt

### SSE Event ID + Catch-up (Phase ζ)

- **Global Counter**: Monotonically increasing `_sseCounter` in `src/server/routes/global.ts`
- **Ring Buffer**: Array of `{ id, event }` entries (MAX_SIZE = 1000)
- **Reconnect**: Client sends `Last-Event-ID` header → server replays missed events from buffer
- **Buffer Overflow**: If `lastId` is older than buffer range → server sends `sync.required` event → client does full bootstrap refresh

### Security Migration (Phase δ)

- **Removed**: `LinuxUserExec`, `buildSudoInvocation`, `opencode-run-as-user.sh`, all sudo wrapper logic
- **Rationale**: Per-user daemon already runs as the correct UID; shell/PTY commands spawn directly without privilege escalation
- **Preserved**: Utility functions `sanitizeUsername`, `resolveLinuxUserHome`, `resolveLinuxUserUID` in `src/system/linux-user-exec.ts`

### Subagent IO Visibility

子代理（subagent）透過 `task()` tool 委派工作時，主 session UI 即時顯示子代理活動。

**資料流**:

1. Task tool 建立子 session 後立即呼叫 `ctx.metadata({ sessionId })` → tool part 的 `state.metadata.sessionId` 在 running 狀態即可用
2. Worker process 的子 session events 透過 `__OPENCODE_BRIDGE_EVENT__` stdout protocol → 主 process `publishBridgedEvent()` → Bus → SSE → frontend sync store
3. `SubagentActivityCard` 組件（`packages/app/src/pages/session/components/message-tool-invocation.tsx`）讀取 `sync.data.message[childSessionId]` 顯示子代理的 tool calls 和文字輸出

**組件結構**:

- `tool === "task"` 的 ToolPart 渲染為 `SubagentActivityCard`（取代通用 MCP card）
- Header: agent type + description + elapsed timer
- Body（collapsible）: tool call 列表（status icon + tool name + subtitle）+ text output
- 狀態: running（spinner, auto-open）/ completed（final output）/ error（error banner + partial activity）

### Shared Context Structure

Per-session structured knowledge space that tracks files, actions, discoveries, and goals across turns. Under context sharing v2 it no longer serves as the primary parent→child bridge; it is now a compaction / observability surface plus parent-side knowledge merge target.

**Module**: `packages/opencode/src/session/shared-context.ts`

**Data Model**:

```typescript
Space {
  sessionID, version, updatedAt, budget,
  goal: string,
  files: FileEntry[],      // path, operation, lines, summary
  discoveries: string[],   // key findings extracted from assistant text
  actions: ActionEntry[],  // tool calls summarized per turn
  currentState: string,    // last paragraph of assistant text
}
```

**Storage**: `["shared_context", sessionID]` — per-session, separate namespace from messages. Both parent and child sessions persist their own Space.

**Update Trigger**: After every assistant turn in `prompt.ts` turn boundary loop (both parent and child sessions). Heuristic extraction: tool parts → files/actions; assistant text → goal/discoveries/currentState.

**V2 Context Sharing Contract**:

1. **Forward Path** (`prompt.ts` child prompt loop):
   - When `session.parentID` exists, child prompt-loop startup loads the parent's visible message history once via `MessageV2.filterCompacted(MessageV2.stream(session.parentID))`.
   - Each child model call prepends that parent message prefix, then inserts a delegated-subagent separator message, then appends the child session's own message history.
   - This path replaces dispatch-time SharedContext snapshot injection as the authoritative context bridge.

2. **Task Dispatch** (`task.ts`):
   - Child prompt seeding now contains only the task prompt / execution prompt parts.
   - `SharedContext.formatForInjection()` and `injectedSharedContextVersion` are no longer part of the dispatch contract for V2 child context sharing.

3. **Idle Compaction** (`prompt.ts` turn boundary, parent sessions only):
   - After turn containing task dispatch, evaluate context utilization.
   - If utilization ≥ `opportunisticThreshold` (default 0.6): use Space snapshot as compaction summary (no LLM call).
   - Falls back to LLM compaction agent if Space is empty.

4. **Overflow Compaction** (`prompt.ts` overflow path, parent sessions only):
   - When context overflows: if Space has content, use as summary instead of calling LLM compaction agent.
   - Falls back to standard LLM compaction agent.

**Child→Parent Feedback** (`task-worker-continuation.ts` on subagent completion):

1. Parent continuation must receive child completion evidence derived from child transcript output; `SharedContext` is no longer the sole return channel.
2. `SharedContext.mergeFrom(parent ← child)` remains in place so child files/actions/discoveries become available for later parent compaction and observability.
3. The V1 `snapshotDiff(childSessionID, injectedSharedContextVersion)` differential relay path is no longer the authority for V2 completion handoff.
4. Child completion must not auto-complete the parent linked todo inside `task` tool runtime. On successful child return, the control plane may clear `waitingOn: subagent`, but the parent orchestrator remains the only authority that can mark the current step completed after it actually consumes `<child_session_output>` and decides the next todo transition.

**Validation Evidence (2026-03-27)**:

- `packages/opencode/src/session/compaction.test.ts` verifies cooldown suppression and emergency-ceiling override for high-prefix sessions.
- `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt-context-sharing.test.ts` verifies model-message assembly order: full parent history → separator → child prompt.
- `packages/opencode/src/session/usage-cache-reuse.test.ts` verifies by-token cached usage is preserved as `tokens.cache.read` for telemetry/accounting.
- `packages/opencode/src/session/usage-by-request.test.ts` verifies by-request provider models with zero token rates remain cost-insensitive in local accounting even with very large input token counts.

**Production Telemetry (2026-03-27, 15 V2 child sessions, OpenAI gpt-5.4)**:

- Forward path confirmed: child first-round input avg 102K tokens (12.4x vs V1's 8.2K), avg 109.8 parent messages prepended.
- R2+ cache hit rate: **92.0%** overall; short-task children (3-5 rounds) reach 98-99%.
- Return path confirmed: `<child_session_output>` synthetic user messages contain child's last 3 assistant outputs (avg 1.5K chars), parent correctly integrates into orchestration flow.
- Cache stability: only 2 isolated misses across all 15 sessions (OpenAI eviction timing), all other rounds show stable prefix hit.
- By-request (Copilot) validation deferred — no child dispatches observed in window.

**Config** (`config.compaction`):

- `sharedContext: boolean` (default true) — disable entirely
- `sharedContextBudget: number` (default 8192 tokens) — Space size cap with consolidation
- `opportunisticThreshold: number 0-1` (default 0.6) — idle compaction trigger

### Continuous Orchestration Control Surface

- Dispatch-first continuous orchestration does **not** mean the session becomes globally idle once `task()` returns. If exactly one background subagent is still active, the parent session remains in an operator-controllable active-child state.
- This active-child state is a session-global control-plane concept distinct from foreground parent streaming state.
- **Single-child invariant** remains authoritative: one parent Orchestrator session may have at most one active background subagent at a time.
- **Stop contract** is staged:
  1. first stop interrupts foreground Orchestrator streaming;
  2. second consecutive stop, if the same child remains active, escalates to child termination.
- **Pinned status surface**: while the active-child state exists, Web and TUI should render a bottom-pinned subagent status surface showing child identity, task title, latest progress/step evidence, and a child-session entry affordance.
- **Presentation strategy**: first implementation should prefer extending the existing thinking / elapsed bottom-status UI family, so active-child state appears as the same class of runtime activity indicator rather than a separate widget system.
- **Child-session entry differs by surface**:
  - Web may expose a route URL / clickable child-session link.
  - When the operator is already inside a child/subsession view, the same pinned status-surface affordance should pivot to an explicit return-to-parent-session navigation target instead of reopening the child route.
  - TUI must use its own session-tree jump/navigation mechanism instead of URL rendering.
- The pinned status surface must remain mounted until authoritative runtime evidence shows either:
  - the parent continuation has taken over and active-child state is cleared; or
  - the child failed / was terminated and active-child state is cleared.
- The transcript-local `SubagentActivityCard` remains a detail surface, but it is no longer sufficient as the only operator-visible child-activity surface once continuous orchestration is active.
- Child/subsession views must not render a large observation-only prompt fallback block at the bottom dock; observation-only is expressed by the absence of conversational input plus explicit navigation back to the parent control surface.
- Continuation cleanup order is authoritative: when `TaskWorkerEvent.Done/Failed` arrives, the parent continuation path clears `active-child` before persistence / resume work proceeds, so the parent control plane does not keep advertising a stale wait state.
- Weak client network / SSE staleness may temporarily make Web appear as if the AI or backend is hung, but that is a presentation-layer symptom amplifier. Runtime stop/continue authority remains backend-owned and must not silently depend on frontend connectivity quality.

**Dispatch 規則**:

- SYSTEM.md §2.3: 一次只派出一個 subagent（sequential execution）
- Prompt-level soft enforcement（無 runtime 強制阻擋）

### Subagent Worker Lifecycle

- **Spawn**: `Bun.spawn([bun, run, index.ts, session, worker])` — independent OS process, no shared memory with daemon
- **IPC**: Bidirectional stdin/stdout JSON-line protocol: `{type:"run"|"ready"|"heartbeat"|"done"|"bridge_event"|"error"}`
- **No timeout**: Workers are waited on unconditionally. The only termination trigger is subprocess death (process exit detected by stdout reader loop). No inactivity timeout exists; long-running LLM calls are expected.
- **Liveness**: `worker.proc.exitCode` checked after unexpected stdout close to distinguish crash from clean exit
- **Continuation & Decoupling**: Subagent lifecycle is decoupled from the parent Orchestrator's wait loop via `Bus.publish(TaskWorkerEvent.Done/Failed)`. The parent continuation path is the authoritative clearing point for `active-child` state, ensuring the Orchestrator does not remain in a stale wait state even if the initial request stream was interrupted.
- **Instance context**: `spawnWorker()` captures `Instance.directory` at spawn time and passes it as Bus event context to all `TaskWorkerEvent.Done/Failed` publishes, so the continuation subscriber can re-establish `Instance.provide()` scope after the originating HTTP request scope has ended.
- **Bridge events**: Worker stdout `__OPENCODE_BRIDGE_EVENT__` lines forwarded to parent via `Bus.publish` for SSE/UI visibility

### Performance Hardening (Phase θ)

- **SDK LRU Cache**: `sdkSet()` in `src/provider/provider.ts` — Map-based FIFO eviction (MAX_SIZE = 50)
- **Server Idle Timeout**: 120s for both TCP and Unix socket modes

### Deployment (webctl.sh)

- `compile-gateway`: Compiles `daemon/opencode-gateway.c` via gcc
- `gateway-start`: Compiles + starts gateway daemon (nohup, PID file tracked)
- `gateway-stop`: Graceful SIGTERM → wait → SIGKILL fallback
- `reload`: Auto-detects dev/prod mode. Dev: kills per-user daemons (bun re-reads source on next request). Prod: builds binary + atomic install + kill daemons.
- `restart`: Runs `reload` then recompiles and restarts gateway if source changed.
- `install.sh --system-init`: Installs `opencode-gateway.service` + `opencode-user@.service` systemd units + gateway binary + login page

### systemd Units

- `opencode-gateway.service`: Root-level gateway daemon (`/usr/local/bin/opencode-gateway`)
- `opencode-user@.service`: Per-user daemon template (`/usr/local/bin/opencode serve --unix-socket ...`)

## Session Read Cache + Rate Limit Layer

Added 2026-04-19 via `specs/_archive/session-poll-cache/`. Defends the daemon against
high-frequency frontend polling on `GET /api/v2/session/{id}` and
`GET /api/v2/session/{id}/message` without forcing clients to migrate off
polling.

### Components (src paths)

- `packages/opencode/src/config/tweaks.ts` — `Tweaks` namespace. Parses
  `/etc/opencode/tweaks.cfg` (override via `OPENCODE_TWEAKS_PATH`). Missing
  file uses defaults + `log.info`; invalid values warn + per-key default
  fallback (AGENTS.md rule 1).
- `packages/opencode/src/server/session-cache.ts` — `SessionCache` namespace.
  In-process LRU keyed by `session:<id>` / `messages:<id>:<limit>`, plus a
  per-session monotonic version counter used in weak ETags.
- `packages/opencode/src/server/rate-limit.ts` — `RateLimit` namespace.
  Token bucket middleware keyed by `${username}:${method}:${routePattern}`,
  with `normalizeRoutePattern()` collapsing opencode ID segments into `:id`
  so per-session URLs share one bucket.
- `packages/opencode/src/server/routes/cache-health.ts` — `GET
/api/v2/server/cache/health` endpoint exposing cache + rate-limit stats
  via the pluggable `registerCacheStatsProvider` /
  `registerRateLimitStatsProvider` pattern.
- `packages/opencode/src/server/routes/session.ts` — `GET /:sessionID`,
  `GET /:sessionID/message`, `GET /:sessionID/autonomous/health` route
  through `SessionCache.get()` with loader-wrapped `Session.get` /
  `Session.messages`; 304 short-circuit via `SessionCache.currentEtag` +
  `isEtagMatch`.

### Invalidation flow

- Worker process writes trigger `Bus.publish(MessageV2.Event.*)` inside the
  worker's local bus.
- `packages/opencode/src/tool/task.ts:publishBridgedEvent` relays those
  events to the daemon's local bus (same mechanism already used for other
  cross-process session state).
- The daemon's `SessionCache.registerInvalidationSubscriber` subscribes to
  `MessageV2.Event.{Updated, Removed, PartUpdated, PartRemoved}` and
  `Session.Event.{Created, Updated, Deleted}`; each event bumps the
  per-session version counter and drops matching cache keys.
  `Session.Event.Deleted` additionally clears the counter entirely (I-4).

### ETag format

`W/"<sessionID>:<version>:<process-epoch>"` where `process-epoch =
Date.now().toString(36)` captured at module load. The epoch makes
post-restart ETag collisions impossible even though the version counter
resets to 0 per process.

### Rate-limit exempt surfaces

`EXEMPT_PATH_PREFIXES` in `rate-limit.ts`:

- `/log`, `/api/v2/global/log` — log ingestion is high-volume by design
- `/api/v2/global/health`, `/api/v2/server/cache/health` — ops inspectability
  must not be throttled
- `/api/v2/server/` (entire prefix) — ops surfaces extend here over time
- `hostname === "opencode.internal"` — internal worker-to-daemon requests

Unresolvable usernames produce a `log.warn` bypass (E-RATE-002) rather than
a silent throttle or a guess.

### Operator tunables (`/etc/opencode/tweaks.cfg`)

- `session_cache_enabled` (default `1`)
- `session_cache_ttl_sec` (default `60`)
- `session_cache_max_entries` (default `500`)
- `ratelimit_enabled` (default `1`)
- `ratelimit_qps_per_user_per_path` (default `10`)
- `ratelimit_burst` (default `20`)

Defaults live in `templates/system/tweaks.cfg` and are copied to
`/etc/opencode/tweaks.cfg` during install. Daemon reads once at startup;
restart to apply changes (same model as `opencode.cfg`).

### Race / integrity notes

- Subscription wiring failure → `subscriptionAlive=false`, `log.warn`, and
  **no memoization**; loader still runs per request (I-3).
- Cumulative stats only (no 5-min sliding window yet) — tracked as a
  follow-up plan candidate. The schema accommodates either implementation.
- The forwarded-to-per-user-daemon path
  (`UserDaemonManager.routeSessionReadEnabled`) is intentionally **not**
  cached on the gateway side; the per-user daemon owns its own cache.

## Question Tool Abort Lifecycle

Runtime SSOT for the `question` tool / `Question.ask` state machine. Added 2026-04-19 alongside [specs/_archive/question-tool-abort-fix/](question-tool-abort-fix/).

### Overview

`Question.ask` is the only blocking tool in the runtime — its `execute` function awaits human input indefinitely. Every other tool either completes in milliseconds or streams delta back to the LLM. Because this tool voluntarily yields control to a human, its lifecycle must be bound to the surrounding stream's `AbortSignal`; otherwise a stream teardown leaves a phantom `pending[id]` entry that:

1. keeps the dialog visible to the user after the stream is already gone
2. lets the user submit an answer that the LLM side no longer consumes
3. causes the AI to re-ask the same question on stream restart — generating the "answer → abort → re-ask" loop

### State machine

States: **Idle → Pending → { Replied | Rejected(manual) | Aborted(stream) } → Idle**

Transitions:

| From            | To       | Trigger                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Idle            | Pending  | `Question.ask({ …, abort })` registers `pending[id]`, publishes `question.asked` (unless `abort.aborted` at entry)                                                        |
| Pending         | Replied  | HTTP `/question.reply` → `Question.reply` deletes pending, calls `dispose()`, publishes `question.replied`, resolves promise                                              |
| Pending         | Rejected | HTTP `/question.reject` → `Question.reject` deletes pending, calls `dispose()`, publishes `question.rejected`, rejects with `RejectedError`                               |
| Pending         | Aborted  | `abort` signal fires → `onAbort` listener deletes pending, publishes `question.rejected` (same event as manual reject), rejects with `RejectedError("aborted: <reason>")` |
| Pending+Replied | Replied  | late `abort` fires after `reply` — `onAbort` finds no `pending[id]` → no-op (idempotent)                                                                                  |

### Cancel reason propagation

`prompt-runtime.cancel(sessionID, reason: CancelReason)` → `controller.abort(reason)` → `AbortSignal.reason` visible to downstream `Question.ask` abort handler via `signal.reason`. `CancelReason` enum (see `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt-runtime.ts`):

- `manual-stop` — user pressed Stop in UI, CLI SIGINT/SIGTERM, ACP `session.abort`
- `rate-limit-fallback` — reserved (processor rotation currently uses `continue`, not `cancel`; would be used if future logic explicitly cancels the old stream)
- `monitor-watchdog` — reserved for future session monitor integration
- `instance-dispose` — Instance state cleanup (daemon restart / user switch)
- `replace` — `prompt-runtime.start({ replace: true })` tearing down the prior AbortController
- `session-switch` — reserved for explicit session-switching paths
- `killswitch` — emergency `KillSwitchService.forceKill` / cancel / pause
- Kill-switch stop semantics are two-layered: `KillSwitchService` must both call `SessionPrompt.cancel(sessionID, "killswitch")` and terminate any active child worker through `tool/task.ts::terminateActiveChild(sessionID)`. Aborting only the parent prompt is insufficient when the orchestrator is blocked waiting on a subagent worker result.
- `parent-abort` — subagent cascade: parent session's abort triggers child session cancel via `tool/task.ts`
- `unknown` — default when no meaningful reason is available (should not occur from internal callers; TypeScript enforces the closed set)

### Observability

- `log.info("cancel", { sessionID, reason, caller })` in `session.prompt-runtime` — `caller` is the first non-framework stack frame of whoever invoked `cancel`
- `log.info("aborted", { id, sessionID, reason })` in `question` — fired by the abort listener when a pending question is torn down by stream abort
- `log.info("aborted-pre-ask", …)` — pre-aborted signal at `Question.ask` entry (no `question.asked` published)
- Grep patterns for incident investigation:
  - `grep '"reason":"rate-limit-fallback"'` — count aborts attributed to rotation
  - `grep 'aborted-pre-ask'` — stream already dead when tool was invoked

### Webapp cache

`QuestionDock` (`packages/app/src/components/question-dock.tsx`) caches user input (tab, answers, typed custom text) under `${sessionID}:${fnv1a32(canonicalJson(questions))}` (see `question-cache-key.ts`):

- sessionID prefix isolates cross-session state
- content hash lets AI re-asks of the same question (new `request.id`) restore the user's draft automatically
- FNV-1a sync chosen over async SHA-1 to avoid a createStore race where the user's fresh keystrokes would be overwritten when async hash resolves (see DD-2 v2 in `specs/_archive/question-tool-abort-fix/design.md`)
- Cache entry is written on `onCleanup` (only when `replied=false`) and cleared on `reply` / `reject` success

## Mandatory Skills Preload Pipeline

Introduced by `specs/_archive/mandatory-skills-preload/` (2026-04-19, state=implementing as of 2026-04-20). Purpose: guarantee "must-be-present-every-round" skills are in system prompt without relying on AI to call the `skill()` tool, and without being subject to the 10-min summarize / 30-min unload idle-decay in `SkillLayerRegistry`.

### Data flow

```
session prompt.ts runLoop (every round, Main + coding subagent)
  ├── InstructionPrompt.system() → AGENTS.md text[] (existing, 10s TTL cache)
  ├── MandatorySkills.resolveMandatoryList({ sessionID, agent, isSubagent })
  │     ├── Main agent  → global + project AGENTS.md, parse <!-- opencode:mandatory-skills --> sentinel blocks
  │     └── coding sub  → coding.txt sentinel block only
  │     → dedup with project-priority order → skillName[]
  ├── MandatorySkills.reconcileMandatoryList({ sessionID, desired })
  │     └── for each previously-pinned mandatory entry not in desired → unpin + emit skill.mandatory_unpinned
  ├── MandatorySkills.preloadMandatorySkills({ sessionID, list, bySkill })
  │     ├── for each name: Skill.get(name)
  │     ├── found     → SkillLayerRegistry.recordLoaded + .pin, emit skill.mandatory_preloaded
  │     └── missing   → log.warn + emit skill.mandatory_missing anomaly event; skip (do NOT throw)
  └── processor.process → llm.ts → SkillLayerRegistry.listForInjection → skill-layer-seam renders <skill_layer> tags into system[]
```

Key properties:

- **Skill content bypasses AI self-discipline**: runtime injects content before `processor.process()`, so AI never needs to call `skill()` for mandatory skills.
- **Not subject to idle-decay**: `pinned=true` short-circuits `applyIdleDecay` (line [175-196 of skill-layer-registry.ts](../packages/opencode/src/session/skill-layer-registry.ts#L175-L196)).
- **Diff-based pin reconciliation**: removing a skill from AGENTS.md sentinel auto-unpins it next round.
- **Loud fallback**: missing SKILL.md file → warn + anomaly event, session remains operational.

### Sentinel block syntax

```markdown
<!-- opencode:mandatory-skills -->

- plan-builder
<!-- /opencode:mandatory-skills -->
```

- HTML comment invisible in AI's markdown read.
- Inline `#` stripped (bullets like `- plan-builder    # required` normalize to `plan-builder`).
- Empty bullets skipped; multi-block merge + dedup (first-occurrence order wins).
- Malformed blocks (unclosed / nested opener) → warn + treat body as one block, continue.

### Source authorities

| Audience                   | Source file                                     | Lives in      | Notes                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Main agent                 | `<repo-root>/AGENTS.md`                         | docsWriteRepo | project-priority in merge         |
| Main agent                 | `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`                  | user XDG      | secondary in merge                |
| coding subagent            | `packages/opencode/src/agent/prompt/coding.txt` | runtime code  | sole source for subagent path     |
| any subagent except coding | —                                               | —             | `resolveMandatoryList` returns [] |

### Observability

Runtime events appended to `RuntimeEventService`:

- `skill.mandatory_preloaded` — info/workflow, when a skill is freshly pinned
- `skill.mandatory_missing` — warn/anomaly, anomalyFlags=[mandatory_skill_missing]
- `skill.mandatory_read_error` — warn/anomaly, anomalyFlags=[mandatory_skill_read_error]
- `skill.mandatory_unpinned` — info/workflow, when user removes skill from AGENTS.md

Dashboard "已載技能" panel should show pinned badges + source label for mandatory entries.

### Current mandatory lists

- **Main agent** (via project + global AGENTS.md): `plan-builder`
- **coding subagent** (via coding.txt sentinel): `code-thinker`

### Related retirement — agent-workflow

`agent-workflow` skill retired on 2026-04-20 as part of this pipeline's rollout:

- Its §5 Syslog-style Debug Contract → merged into `code-thinker/SKILL.md` §3 as single source of truth.
- Its §0 core principles / §6 Narration / §7 Interrupt-safe Replanning / §8 WAITING_APPROVAL format / §10 Ops digest → merged into opencode repo AGENTS.md under "Autonomous Agent 核心紀律" (runtime-injected every round per 第三條).
- Its §1-§5 spec-driven execution content was already covered by `plan-builder` SKILL.md §16 Execution Contract.
- `templates/AGENTS.md`, `templates/system_prompt.md`, `templates/global_constitution.md`, `packages/opencode/src/agent/prompt/coding.txt`, and `enablement.json` references all cleaned up.
- Skills submodule commit `9103663` removes `agent-workflow/SKILL.md` and rewrites `code-thinker/SKILL.md`.

See `specs/_archive/mandatory-skills-preload/design.md` DD-8/DD-10 and `docs/events/event_20260419_mandatory_skills_preload.md` for full decision trace.

## Capability Layer vs Conversation Layer (Session Rebind Epoch)

Introduced by `specs/_archive/session-rebind-capability-refresh/` (2026-04-20). Extends and refines the Mandatory Skills Preload Pipeline above.

### Layer boundary

Session prompts live at two distinct layers; each has independent lifecycle rules.

| Layer            | Content                                                                                                                                           | Lifecycle                                                                                                         | Checkpoint-safe?                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Capability**   | system prompt, driver prompt, AGENTS.md (global + project), coding.txt sentinel, skill content (pinned via `SkillLayerRegistry`), enablement.json | **Never frozen**. Refreshed on rebind events; between events, served from per-(sessionID, epoch) in-memory cache. | ❌ must not be captured by checkpoint/SharedContext |
| **Conversation** | user messages, assistant responses, tool results, task progress, `SharedContext` snapshot, rebind checkpoint messages                             | Accumulates. Compressible via existing `SessionCompaction` / `SharedContext`.                                     | ✅ checkpoint/shared-context owns compression       |

Conversation-layer state is safe to freeze because it records "what happened". Capability-layer state must re-read authoritative sources because it describes "what the agent can do right now" — AGENTS.md / SKILL.md / enablement.json can change between rebinds.

### Rebind events (sole invalidation triggers)

Five canonical triggers bump a session's `RebindEpoch`; each bumps the epoch by 1 and emits a `session.rebind` RuntimeEvent. No other code path may invalidate the capability-layer cache.

| Trigger           | Source                                         | Example                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `daemon_start`    | Lazy on first `runLoop` iteration per session  | Fresh daemon process; session first used |
| `session_resume`  | `POST /session/:id/resume` from UI             | User re-opens an idle session in UI      |
| `provider_switch` | Pre-loop detection in `prompt.ts:~969`         | Model/account switch within a session    |
| `slash_reload`    | `/reload` slash command                        | User manually refreshes                  |
| `tool_call`       | `refresh_capability_layer` tool (AI-initiated) | AI detects stale capability layer        |

### Cache contract

- Cache key = `(sessionID, epoch)`. Per-session isolation (DD-1); no global epoch.
- Max 2 entries retained per session (`MAX_ENTRIES_PER_SESSION=2`) — `current + previous` for R3 fallback semantics (DD-3 amended).
- **No time-based TTL**: `InstructionPrompt.systemCache` legacy 10s TTL was replaced with epoch-based invalidation. Cache stays valid indefinitely until next rebind.
- **Reinject failure retains previous cache** — loud-warn via `capability_layer.refresh_failed` anomaly event + `get()` falls back to previous epoch's entry. Session never crashes due to stale AGENTS.md / missing skill.

### Refresh order contract (DD-4)

When both events co-occur (e.g. provider switch), the pipeline **always** refreshes capability layer before applying conversation-layer compression:

```
bumpEpoch(sessionID, trigger)   ← invalidates capability cache
  ↓
CapabilityLayer.reinject(sessionID, newEpoch)   ← reads fresh AGENTS.md + driver + skills
  ↓
[optional] SessionCompaction.compactWithSharedContext(...)   ← rebuilds messages for new provider
  ↓
runLoop builds system[] from (fresh capability + compacted messages)
```

New providers / models see the current capability layer in their very first LLM call, not a version cached from the previous provider's startup.

### Silent init round (DD-5)

UI `POST /session/:id/resume` triggers a bump + reinject without invoking the LLM, writing message history, or triggering autonomous continuation. Cost-free. If the session is `busy`/`retry` at signal receipt, the daemon skips silent reinject (the in-flight `runLoop` will cache-miss on its next iteration and self-heal) — no lock, no preempt.

### Rate limits

- **Session-level**: `RebindEpoch.bumpEpoch` sliding window = 5 bumps per 1000ms/session (DD-11). Exceeding emits `session.rebind_storm` anomaly; bump rejected.
- **Tool-level**: `refresh_capability_layer` tool = 3 invocations per `(sessionID, messageID)` (DD-6). Exceeding emits `tool.refresh_loop_suspected` anomaly; tool returns rate-limited status without bumping epoch.

### Components

- `packages/opencode/src/session/rebind-epoch.ts` — RebindEpoch namespace (state + rate limit + event emit)
- `packages/opencode/src/session/capability-layer.ts` — per-(sessionID, epoch) cache + R3 fallback lookup
- `packages/opencode/src/session/capability-layer-loader.ts` — production loader (reads AGENTS.md + pins skills via `MandatorySkills.loadAndPinAll`)
- `packages/opencode/src/session/instruction.ts` — `InstructionPrompt.system(sessionID?)` now epoch-keyed
- `packages/opencode/src/session/prompt.ts` — `runLoop` wires `ensureCapabilityLoaderRegistered` + `CapabilityLayer.get` + daemon_start lazy bump + provider_switch bump
- `packages/opencode/src/tool/refresh-capability-layer.ts` — AI-initiated tool
- `packages/opencode/src/command/index.ts` (`Command.reloadHandler`) — user-initiated slash command
- `packages/opencode/src/server/routes/session.ts` — `POST /:sessionID/resume` endpoint

### Observability events

- `session.rebind` (info/workflow) — every successful `bumpEpoch`
- `capability_layer.refreshed` (info/workflow) — `reinject` succeeded
- `session.rebind_storm` (warn/anomaly) — session rate limit exceeded
- `capability_layer.refresh_failed` (error/anomaly) — reinject threw; previous cache retained
- `tool.refresh_loop_suspected` (warn/anomaly) — per-turn tool limit exceeded

See `specs/_archive/session-rebind-capability-refresh/design.md` (15 DDs) for the full decision trace.

## Tool Framework Contract

### Tool.define: execute() receives parsed args

`Tool.define(id, init)` wraps a tool's `execute(args, ctx)` to guarantee that by the time user code runs:

1. `parameters.parse(args)` has succeeded.
2. The **parsed** value — not the raw LLM arguments — is what `execute()` receives.

This means any `z.preprocess` / `z.transform` / `z.default` declared in `parameters` takes effect at runtime. Tool authors must **not** re-parse args inside `execute`, because side-effecting transforms would run twice.

Validation errors route through `formatValidationError` (if provided) → thrown as `Error` whose message is the hint; otherwise a generic fallback wrapping the `ZodError`. `execute` is not called on validation failure.

### Tool part `state.input` persistence

The session processor (`session/processor.ts`) persists tool-call arguments on the tool part's `state.input` field:

| Status      | `state.input` content                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `running`   | Raw LLM args (short-lived; UI renderers must defensive-normalize)                                                                            |
| `completed` | **Normalized** shape: `ToolRegistry.getParameters(toolName).safeParse(value.input).data` when available; raw if registry miss or parse fails |
| `error`     | Raw LLM args (forensic evidence — we need the exact shape that failed)                                                                       |

`ToolRegistry.getParameters(id)` caches each tool's parameters schema on first lookup (process-lifetime `Map`). Registry miss / parse failure is logged at `debug` level; state.input falls back to raw and downstream UIs still render via defensive normalize.

### Question tool normalize — cross-runtime single source of truth

`normalizeQuestionInput` / `normalizeSingleQuestion` live in `packages/sdk/js/src/v2/question-normalize.ts` so both server runtime (`Question.normalize` re-exports from SDK) and client runtimes (webapp `QuestionDock` / `message-part.tsx`, TUI `session/index.tsx`) use the same pure implementation. Any future tool with cross-runtime shape coercion should follow the same pattern.

See `specs/_archive/question-tool-input-normalization/` for the full RCA, design (DD-1…DD-6), and test vectors.

## UI Freshness Contract (session-ui-freshness)

**Principle**: session-scoped UI data freshness is tracked via client-side `receivedAt` timestamps, never via SSE connection state. Connection health is a transport concern; freshness is a data concern. The two must stay decoupled.

**Authoritative path**:

- Event reducer stamps `receivedAt = Date.now()` on every session-scoped write (`State.session_status`, `State.active_child`, monitor poll items) via intersection type `ClientStampMeta`. Inline field, not a wrapper (DD-1 / DD-8).
- `packages/app/src/hooks/use-freshness-clock.ts` exposes `freshnessNow` — a single module-level Solid signal ticking once per second (DD-2). Every freshness-aware memo subscribes to the same signal.
- `packages/app/src/utils/freshness.ts` exports `classifyFidelity(receivedAt, now, thresholds, enabled, opts)` as the **single source of truth** for classification. Three buckets: `fresh` / `stale` / `hard-stale`. Invalid `receivedAt` (undefined / NaN / Infinity / ≤0) forces `hard-stale` with optional warn callback (DD-4, AGENTS.md rule 1).
- Thresholds + feature flag come from `/config/tweaks/frontend` via `frontend-tweaks.ts`: `ui_session_freshness_enabled` (0/1, default 0), `ui_freshness_threshold_sec` (default 15), `ui_freshness_hard_timeout_sec` (default 60). Daemon-side parser clamps ranges + enforces soft < hard.

**UI consumers** (freshness-aware memos):

- `pages/session.tsx` activeChildDock memo → `session-prompt-dock.tsx` applies opacity + "stale" hint
- `pages/session/session-side-panel.tsx` process-card loop → opacity + "updated Ns ago" italic line, elapsed timer frozen on hard-stale
- `pages/session/tool-page.tsx` process-list → same pattern

**Forbidden**:

- Any signal / memo / toast that surfaces SSE connection health to the UI layer. The 2026-04-20 RCA (I-4, `docs/events/event_2026-04-20_frontend_oom_rca.md`) documented the OOM cascade that this rule prevents.
- Silent fallback to `fresh` when `receivedAt` is missing / invalid. Always `hard-stale` + rate-limited warn.
- Multiple `setInterval` freshness tickers. The module-level singleton in `use-freshness-clock.ts` is the only valid driver.

**Feature flag rollout**: `ui_session_freshness_enabled=0` (default) → `classifyFidelity` early-returns `"fresh"`, so every memo renders baseline (byte-equivalent to pre-plan `2fa1b0b2d~1`). Operators opt in by flipping the flag in `/etc/opencode/tweaks.cfg` and restarting the daemon. Retirement trigger is acceptance-based (not time-based): once R1–R6 pass with flag=1, a follow-up `amend` removes the flag and dead code.

See `specs/_archive/session-ui-freshness/` for the full lifecycle, design decisions DD-1 through DD-8, error catalogue, and observability contract.

## Daemon Lifecycle Authority

安全自重啟契約（spec: `specs/_archive/safe-daemon-restart/`）。

**唯一權威**: Gateway（`/usr/local/bin/opencode-gateway`，source `daemon/opencode-gateway.c`）是 per-user bun daemon 的唯一 lifecycle owner。Daemon 不 fork 自己、不 exec 兄弟、不呼叫 `webctl.sh` 做 spawn/kill。

**合法 restart 路徑**:

1. AI（或 UI 設定頁的 Restart Web 按鈕）呼叫 `system-manager:restart_self` tool（或直接 POST `/api/v2/global/web/restart`）。
2. Daemon endpoint 在 gateway-daemon 模式下 spawn `webctl.sh restart [--force-gateway]`。
3. `webctl.sh` smart-detect dirty 層（stamp 比對）並只 rebuild 變動部分（daemon bundle / frontend bundle / gateway C binary）；install 到系統路徑。
4. Webctl 成功 → daemon `process.exit(0)` → gateway 的 SIGCHLD handler 回 `state=DEAD` → 下一個 HTTP 請求觸發 `ensure_daemon_running` 乾淨 spawn。
5. Webctl 失敗（任何層 exit ≠ 0）→ daemon 不自殺，回 5xx + errorLogPath；系統維持舊版本可用。
6. `--force-gateway` → webctl `systemctl restart opencode-gateway`；systemd respawn 新 binary；期間所有 per-user daemon 斷線 3-5s（**使用者會感受到**）。

**自癒（phase 1 of safe-daemon-restart）**:

- `ensure_socket_parent_dir()`: spawn 前 `mkdir -p /run/user/<uid>/opencode/` + chown + chmod 0700。tmpfs 清掉也會自動重建。
- `detect_lock_holder_pid()`: 讀 `~/<user>/.config/opencode/daemon.lock`（JSON pid 檔，非 kernel flock），驗 `/proc/<pid>` st_uid 比對。
- `cleanup_orphan_daemon()`: SIGTERM → 1000ms poll → SIGKILL → 500ms reap。`waitpid(pid, NULL, WNOHANG)` 在 poll loop 內防殭屍。
- `ensure_daemon_running()` adopt 失敗後**先清 orphan 再 spawn**，解 2026-04-20 `waitpid ECHILD loop` 問題。

**Bash tool denylist**（`packages/opencode/src/tool/bash.ts` `DAEMON_SPAWN_DENYLIST`）: 擋 `webctl.sh (dev-start|dev-refresh|restart|...)`, `bun serve --unix-socket`, `opencode serve`, `kill $(pgrep opencode)`, `systemctl restart opencode-gateway`。違規丟 `FORBIDDEN_DAEMON_SPAWN`，log `denylist-block rule=...`。

**Invariants**:

- 每個 uid 最多一隻活的 bun daemon（gateway.lock JSON file + `kill(pid, 0)` liveness）
- Daemon pid 一定在 gateway `DaemonInfo.pid` 裡；否則視為 orphan
- Socket file 存在 ⇔ daemon alive & listening
- JWT uid 必須 = 目標 daemon uid

違反任一 invariant = P0 bug。

## Responsive Orchestrator (2026-04-23, spec `responsive-orchestrator` state=living)

Main agent (orchestrator) stays responsive while subagents run. `task` tool dispatches are **asynchronous**: the tool returns a `dispatched` stub immediately, the assistant turn closes, and the session releases its busy lock. Subagent results arrive on a subsequent turn as a one-line system-prompt addendum — they are NOT appended to the visible chat log.

### Dispatch contract

```
main agent emits task(description, prompt, subagent_type)
  ↓ (synchronous, <200ms)
task tool
  ├─ allocate jobId (= toolCallID)
  ├─ spawn subagent worker + register
  ├─ detach background watcher (IIFE)
  └─ return { status: "dispatched", jobId, childSessionID, output: "<instructions for LLM>" }
  ↓
main agent's assistant turn closes naturally; session → idle
```

Meanwhile, in background:

```
subagent runloop → writes terminal finish to disk (stop | error | canceled | rate_limited | quota_low)
  ↓
background watcher (watchdog A/B/C) detects
  ↓
Bus.publish(task.completed { jobId, parentSessionID, childSessionID, status, finish, elapsedMs, errorDetail?, rotateHint? })
  ↓
pending-notice-appender subscriber
  ↓
parent session info.json#pendingSubagentNotices += PendingSubagentNotice
  ↓ (next user turn)
prompt assemble reads notices → renderNoticeAddendum(n) → system prompt addendum + atomically drain
```

### Subagent self-protection

- **R3 rate-limit bounded wait**: subagent escalation to parent is bounded by `subagent_escalation_wait_ms` (default 30 s, tweak). On timeout, subagent writes `finish: "rate_limited"` with errorDetail and exits cleanly.
- **R6 proactive quota wrap-up**: post-turn check reads account remaining; if ≤ `subagent_quota_low_red_line_percent` (default 5 %), subagent injects a wrap-up directive into its own context, runs one final summary turn, writes `finish: "quota_low"` with `rotateHint { exhaustedAccountId, remainingPercent, directive: "rotate-before-redispatch" }`, and exits.

### LLM-facing operator tools

- `cancel_task(jobId, reason?)` — abort one running subagent via stdin cancel command; single-authority pattern (DD-6) means the normal disk-terminal pipeline still delivers the cancellation notice.
- `system-manager.list_subagents({ parentSessionID?, includeFinished? })` — MCP tool, lists active + recently-finished subagents with status/finish/elapsedMs/dispatchedAt.
- `system-manager.read_subsession({ sessionID, sinceMessageID?, limit? })` — MCP tool, reads child session messages; structured error on missing/inaccessible session (never throws).

### Historical fix

This architecture **restores the pre-2026-04-09 async dispatch intent** that was regressed by commit `c32b9612b` (which replaced the Bus-event-chain delivery with a synchronous `await worker.done` to fix race-induced "parent never resumes" bug). The replacement delivery substrate is disk-terminal + watchdog A (race-free, survives IPC severance) instead of the original racy Bus chain.

### Invariants

- Every `tool_use` gets a paired `tool_result` in the same turn (stub satisfies provider hard requirement)
- Every terminal subagent finish delivers a `PendingSubagentNotice` within `DISK_GRACE_MS + WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_MS` (≤ 10 s) — even if IPC is severed
- Each notice is consumed exactly once (per-turn atomic drain)
- Main agent never blocks on subagent lifecycle

Violations = P0 (user-facing orchestrator hang).

### Open issues (not in scope)

- `I-1` subagent status bar hydration after reload / multi-client
- `I-4` mobile UX collapse on large sessions (next spec)

See `specs/_archive/responsive-orchestrator/` for full documentation (proposal.md, spec.md, design.md DD-1..DD-11, IDEF0/GRAFCET, C4, sequence, tasks.md, handoff.md, errors.md, observability.md, test-vectors.json, issues.md).

## Incoming Attachments Lifecycle (2026-05-03)

Two specs together define this surface:

1. **`specs/_archive/repo-incoming-attachments/`** — repo-anchored upload layout, per-file history journal, AttachmentRefPart carrier with `repo_path` + `sha256`. **STILL CURRENT** for the upload + history + AI-facing routing-hint parts (DD-1 / DD-2 / DD-6 / DD-7 / DD-8 / DD-12 / DD-13 / DD-14 / DD-17).
2. **`specs/_archive/docxmcp-http-transport/`** — replaces the bind-mount-based dispatcher implementation with HTTP Streamable transport over Unix domain socket, per-user docker compose container, multipart `POST /files` + token-based tool args. **SUPERSEDED** in repo-incoming-attachments: DD-3 (mcp container `/state` mount), DD-5 (host staging dir), DD-11 (hard-link + break-on-write), DD-15 (EXDEV cross-fs fallback), DD-16 (host-side manifest sha integrity).

The earlier description below (layout / layered model / dispatcher boundary / tool-write hook / drift safety net) is updated post-cutover to reflect the HTTP-transport reality.

**Layout (per project):**

```
<projectRoot>/
  incoming/
    .history/<filename>.jsonl       per-file append-only journal
    <filename>                       canonical bytes (atomic-written)
    <stem>/                          mcp tool bundle co-resident here
      description.md / outline.md / media/ / manifest.json
```

**Layered model:**

- **Layer 1 — repo (canonical)**: `<repo>/incoming/<filename>` is the source of truth. New uploads write here directly; the `attachments` table is no longer touched on the new path.
- **Layer 2 — opencode dispatcher**: HTTP uploader. On tool call, multipart-POSTs the file to the per-app `/files` endpoint over the app's transport, swaps the path in args for the returned token, awaits the result, decodes any returned `bundle_tar_b64` into the bundle's repo location, and DELETEs the token.
- **Layer 3 — mcp container**: a per-user docker compose service exposing MCP Streamable HTTP over a Unix domain socket bound at `/run/docxmcp/docxmcp.sock` inside the container. **No host filesystem visibility** beyond the IPC rendezvous dir (the only bind mount the cross-cutting policy permits). Container's bundle cache lives on a docker named volume (`docxmcp-cache`), invisible to the host.

**Carrier**: `MessageV2.AttachmentRefPart` carries `repo_path` + `sha256` for new refs; legacy refs (no `repo_path`) keep going through the `attachments` table. Both readable indefinitely; no schema migration required.

**Dispatcher boundary (`packages/opencode/src/incoming/dispatcher.ts`)** — post HTTP-transport rewrite:
- `before(toolName, args, appId, sessionID)` — scans args for project-relative paths, multipart-POSTs each to the app's `/files` endpoint (resolved from mcp-apps.json's `transport` + `url`; for `unix://` URLs the dispatcher uses Bun's `{unix: socketPath}` fetch option), records the returned tokens, and rewrites the path → token in the args.
- `after(result, ctx)` — looks for `structuredContent.bundle_tar_b64` in the mcp tool's result; if present, base64-decode → `tar -xf` into `<projectRoot>/<sourceDir>/<stem>/`. Best-effort `DELETE /files/{token}` for every token issued in `before()`.
- The previous bind-mount mechanics — hard-link cache, EXDEV cross-fs fallback, manifest sha integrity — were retired in the cutover. `breakHardLinkBeforeWrite` is now a no-op stub kept for ABI compatibility; tools no longer call it.

**Tool-write hook**: `maybeBreakIncomingHardLink` is now a no-op (no shared inodes left to detach). `maybeAppendToolWriteHistory(filepath, "<tool>", sessionID)` continues to write per-tool history journal entries on `Write` / `Edit` to `incoming/**`. `Bash` is still not hooked.

**Drift safety net**: `IncomingHistory.lookupCurrentSha` cheap-stats the live file (mtime + sizeBytes) against the last-known history entry; mismatch triggers a recompute and a `drift-detected` history entry. Catches external editors that bypass the tool-write hook.

**Decisions worth knowing system-wide (post-cutover):**

From `specs/_archive/repo-incoming-attachments/`:
- DD-1 fail-fast on no `session.project.path`.
- DD-2 jsonl history per file at `incoming/.history/<filename>.jsonl`.
- DD-12 filename sanitize (NFC + control strip + 256-byte cap).
- DD-13 jsonl rotation at 1000 lines.
- DD-14 result-path rewriting is a scoped string replacement.
- DD-17 new uploads live in repo + JSON metadata in `AttachmentRefPart` (`repo_path` + `sha256`); legacy `attachments` table untouched and remains readable.

From `specs/_archive/docxmcp-http-transport/`:
- DD-1 transport: MCP Streamable HTTP framing carried over Unix domain socket.
- DD-2 file API: multipart raw bytes (no base64), token returned.
- DD-3 token format `tok_<32-char-base32>`.
- DD-12 UDS bind mount of the IPC rendezvous dir is the only allowed bind mount (cross-cutting policy).
- DD-13 lint guard at `McpAppStore.addApp` + audit endpoint.
- DD-15 per-user docker compose project.
- DD-16 streamable HTTP framing retained (TCP port replaced by UDS, not the protocol).
- DD-17 system-level service deferred to a future spec.

**Cross-cutting policy**: bind mount banned across the mcp ecosystem. Sole exception: IPC rendezvous dir matching `/run/user/<uid>/opencode/sockets/<app>/` ↔ `/run/<app>/`. Lint enforces at register time. Audit via `GET /api/v2/mcp/store/audit-bind-mounts`.

**Observability**: tail with `tail -F ~/.local/share/opencode/log/debug.log | grep -E '"service":"(incoming|mcp\.client|mcp\.store)"'`. Bus events: `incoming.history.appended`, `incoming.dispatcher.http-upload-{started,succeeded,failed}`, `incoming.dispatcher.bundle-published`, `mcp.transport.connected`, `mcp.store.bind-mount-rejected`.

**Cross-repo contract (docxmcp)**: docxmcp ships a per-user docker compose with the HTTP MCP server bound to `/run/docxmcp/docxmcp.sock`, which is bind-mounted onto `/run/user/${UID}/opencode/sockets/docxmcp/docxmcp.sock` on the host. The image also ships `bin-wrappers/<toolname>` shell scripts for CLI users (docker cp + docker exec; not in opencode's AI tool catalog). See `~/projects/docxmcp/HANDOVER.md`.

### SOP: every mcp app that processes uploaded files (2026-05-03)

Generalizes the docxmcp pattern into a contract any future mcp app
(xlsx-mcp / pptx-mcp / pdf-mcp / ...) must follow.

**The pipeline:**

```
upload  → <repo>/incoming/<filename>.<ext>     [repo persistent layer]
   → dispatcher.before: POST /files → token, swap path → token in args
   → mcp container processes
       (a) FIRST CALL per token: idempotently auto-decompose the file
           into <token_dir>/<convention>/   (e.g. unpacked/ for docxmcp)
       (b) tool runs, may produce more files in <token_dir>/...
       (c) snapshot+diff+tar+b64 newly-touched files into
           structuredContent.bundle_tar_b64
   → dispatcher.after: extract bundle to <repo>/incoming/<stem>/
   → AI reads any bundled file via plain `read` against incoming/<stem>/...
```

**The contract for a new mcp app:**

| | Required / recommended | What |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **must** | Implement the bundle producer in the call_tool wrapper: snapshot token_dir before call, diff after, tar+b64 new/touched files into `structuredContent.bundle_tar_b64`. Reference impl: `docxmcp/bin/mcp_server.py` `_pre_snapshot` / `_maybe_build_bundle`. |
| 2 | **should** | First-call auto-decompose to a documented convention dir under token_dir (docxmcp uses `unpacked/`). Idempotent: skip if convention dir already exists so AI's edits are not overwritten. |
| 3 | **should** | Tool descriptions mention the convention dir name and that decomposed files appear at `incoming/<stem>/<convention>/...` on host. AI then knows to use plain `read` on those paths. |
| 4 | **must** | Bundle producer excludes the original upload (only ships NEW files) so the host bundle stays small. |
| 5 | **must not** | Use any host bind mount for data interchange. The bundle path is the only sanctioned IPC for files going host ← container. |

**Why the pattern matters**: AI works in two modes against any uploaded
file — (i) read/inspect (use `bash` directly; mcp adds nothing), (ii)
structural mutation (use mcp tools that need the file's internal
representation). The auto-decompose + bundle pipeline gives mode (ii) a
reliable bridge: the file's decomposition appears on host
synchronously with the first tool call, so subsequent edits and reads
are plain filesystem ops with no container round-trip.

**Reference implementation (docxmcp)**:
- `bin/mcp_server.py` — `_ensure_decomposed` (convention=`unpacked/`, zipfile.extractall + lxml pretty-print), `_pre_snapshot` / `_maybe_build_bundle` (snapshot+diff+tar+b64).
- `packages/opencode/src/incoming/dispatcher.ts` — `after()` decodes `structuredContent.bundle_tar_b64`, untars to `<projectRoot>/<sourceDir>/<stem>/`.
